Oh yes! Thank you Apple, now iTunes UK has a bunch of films for you to buy or rent! This means I am now going to have to a) Buy more storage b) Get a second job to afford all the films I am going to buy!

New films like Cloverfield seem to be about £10.99 to buy whereas older films seem to be about £6.99.

You can also rent a number of films for about £2.49 and up depending on the age of the film. 

The restriction of rental films seems to be that you can rent it for 30 days and watch it as many times in a 48 hour period (reminds me of being in a hotel to be honest). That *that* great, considering that lovefilm (or NetFlix if you are in the US) let you have the DVD as long as you like.

Maybe a subscription model needs to be introduced, rather than the old style "Blockbuster £3 a film per night" model.

Anyway, I think its awesome news... and a great way for my wages to disappear in a fit of entertainment.
