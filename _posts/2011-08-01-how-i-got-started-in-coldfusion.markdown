<p>Steve Bryant came up with the excellent idea of August 1st being designated <a href="http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day" title="Steve Bryant: August 1, 2011 is "How I Get Started in ColdFusion" Day">How I Got Started In ColdFusion Day</a>, for which ColdFusion users tell their origin story, So here goes mine!
</p>

<p>
	Back in the mists of time, I had started a company called Creative Overload. We were mainly doing flat HTML websites, but specialised in VRML sites, and had done some interesting work for Brixton Academy and Virgin Radio at the time. Sadly, I saw myself as not experienced enough to be running such a company and left it in the capable hands of my then co-directors and left to find a new job somewhere else.  
</p>

<p>
	The job that I ended up taking was of Lead Web Developer at an ISP/Web Agency called NETTEC PLC. It was here (and over the many years I worked there) that I managed to work with many clients that were absolutely amazing. But I digress... 
</p>
<p>
	In the first few months that I was at Nettec Plc, we started working on a large Intershop site, the first CD's, Videos and games website in the UK with full transaction capabilities, and awesome side project of the Kingfisher Group, which at the time owned Wollies and other stores, but it was not for this project I used ColdFusion, it was actually an insurance company down the road that were looking to make choosing a policy much easier. 
</p>

<p>
	I don't recall from where it come, but I had a version of ColdFusion Studio installed on my machine and it had an awesome little wizzard attached to create a master detail page. And within a few hours and their database I had manged to do just that! I was amazed! I mean, I had been working with Perl so far and here was something that made sense, didn't need so many strange characters and just fit! 
</p>

<p>At Nettec we then did a lot of projects with ColdFusion, even being one of the main Allaire and then Macromedia partners in the UK, I even moved on to be a Spectra Specialist (for my sins) which I did all the way up to 2004/5</p>

<p>There you have it. How I got started with ColdFusion</p>
