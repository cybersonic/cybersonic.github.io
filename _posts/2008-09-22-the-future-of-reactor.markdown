<p>I am not sure many people would have heard this as we did a little bit of a "soft" announcement, but I shall be taking over the <a title="Reactor Framework - Trac" href="http://trac.reactorframework.org/">Reactor Project</a> from Doug Hughes! 
</p>
<p>This is awesome, and I am glad some people had some faith in me, especially since I am not very vocal in the mailing list (I tended to bug Doug more than anyone else!)</p>
<p>
Hopefully this will mean that Reactor gets more love and even, maybe, a few more new features in the future.
</p>
<p>We are meeting this Wednesday at 12pm PST (5pm GMT) to discuss the future of the project in the <a href="http://connect.reactorframework.org">Reactor Connect Meeting room</a>
This initial meeting will be more of an organisational one, to pass the baton so to speak.
</p>
