<p>I have recently moved home and I am of course, without cable internet for a while whilst they install it (don't get me started on that yet!). So that I can have a bit of internet, I am using my iPhone tethering feature, but I also want to connect to the house wifi (so I can share printers and what have you). </p>
<p>The problem comes in that whenever I connect to the wifi (that has no connection to the internet) my computer then ignores my phone (as it should) and therefore I don't have internet connection! </p>
<p>There is a simple way to change this in OS X: Go to the Apple Menu Item -&gt; System Preferences -&gt; Network</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then click on the little gear item below the list of services and select "Set Service Order..."</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/content/SelectServiceOrder.png" alt="" width="301" height="693" /></p>
<p>And finally you can drag up (or down) the priority of the services! </p>
