<p>We are running a great little competition that with just a few lines of code (ok, 4K total file size) you can win a ticket to cf.Objective on April 22-24, 2010 at the Hyatt Regency Minneapolis, MN! </p>
<p>There are few rules to the competition, but basically just write some code that shows off <a href="http://www.getrailo.org/index.cfm/download/">Railo Open Source</a> server's features.</p>
<p>Check out the rules and some ideas over at the <a href="http://www.railo.ch/blog/index.cfm/2010/3/12/Take-the-Railo-4k-Challenge-and-win-a-ticket-to-cfObjective">Railo Blog</a>!</p>
