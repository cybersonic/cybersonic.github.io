We found out today that Michael Offner, formerly of the Railo Company has split off and forked Railo into a new project called **Lucee** ( pronounced *Lucy* )!

This is exciting news as it seems that all the most prominent projects are getting their own forks recently (see node.js). 

The project is now part of a not-for-profit Swiss Association called the [Lucee Association](http://lucee.org/) and is supported by corporate members such as:

* [Ortus](http://www.ortussolutions.com/) Solutions (famous for ColdBox) 
* [Pixl8](http://www.pixl8.co.uk/) (famous for PresideCMS) 
* [Rasia](http://www.rasia.ch/) (ex Railo members) 
* [Daemon](http://www.daemon.com.au/) (famous for FarCry and a lot of things in the CFML community) 

What does this mean for the Railo (now Lucee) community? We think that it is a rebrand and re-focus. Which can only be good things! 

It also means that other companies and individuals have a channel to support the project, for example [CMD](http://charliemikedelta.com) and [Vivio Tech](https://www.viviotech.net/) are already on board as corporate supporters of the project to support future development.

The team at [CMD](http://charliemikedelta.com) will still be using Lucee in future projects and wish the Lucee team best of luck.
