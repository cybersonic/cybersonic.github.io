Ahh, padrino, I see you have made it to my blog... you show me proper respect, si?

*removes cotton wads from inside cheeks*

I got back from a couple of drinks with an old friend of mine last night to find that some superb person had sent me The Godfather PS2 game from my amazon wish list! Thank you paisano! You are truly of the Cosa-Nostra (not to be confused with the Cafe-Costa which is a coffee shop)

I also recieved one of those little red cards that the post office leave to say "We got your package, you wanna get it, you come and get it" so I am going to spend the whole week until I can go and pick it up (the depot is in the back end of nowhere) in a state of suspense (not to be confused with suspenders)


So thank you mystery gift sender! The invoice says not your name but I salute you!
