I have been spending some time adding new features to CFEclipse and I thought I would let you have a bit of a preview of what is coming up.

1) Dictionary View Enhancements: you can now view Coldfusion tags and functions either sorted alphabetically or by category

2) Tag Insert: from the dictionary view you are now able to insert tags and have a dialog to enter the values you want. 

3) Tag Editors: you will now be able to right click on a tag and edit that tag. There are now dialogs for each tag in ColdFusion with some nice layouts. 

4) Usablity fixes: you can now comment and uncomment using the same CTRL+SHIFT+m key combo

5) CF Toolbar: There  will be a toolbar at the top of the editor that allows quick access to commonly used Coldfusion Tags and features, something like Homesite and the Insert panel in DW

For this toolbar (which is currently in  development) we are seeking a good designer to contribute to the project by creating a number of icons that relate to coldfusion tags and functions. We have a number of them but we need a lot more. So if you know a designer or are a designer and you would like to contribute to the project, let me know!

Pay is minimal (a couple of pints and maybe a kebab later) but much kudos to be gained!
