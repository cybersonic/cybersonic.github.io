A little <a href="http://twitter.com/bigmadkev/statuses/140149722" title="Twitter / Kev McCabe: @markdrew  mmmmm eclipse 3....">twitter message</a> from <a href="http://inner-rhythm.co.uk/blog/" title="Inner-Rhythm.co.uk">Kev</a> got me thinking about something totally unrelated really, but it might explain a few things. 

Let me fill you in with a few facts first:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="Eclipse.org home">Eclipse</a> just released version 3.3. Last year, at the same time, they released 3.2 and the year before that 3.1</li>
	<li>Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/" title="Adobe - Products : ColdFusion MX 7">ColdFusion</a> going to be 12 years old tomorrow (10th of July) </li>
	<li>I am going to be 33 on the 11th of July</li>
	
</ul>

Take all these facts together and you start seeing a pattern! I share (nearly) a birthday with a technology I love. I work on <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" title="CFEclipse: The ColdFusion IDE for Eclipse">CFEclipse</a> which is built on the Eclipse platform, which releases a version for the last 3 years that matches my age, within two weeks of my birthday, hmm... this is real synchronicity at work here don't you think?

Anyway, Happy (Early) Birthday ColdFusion, may Adobe keep releasing great software for many years to come!

(just as a thought exercise, do you think they will release CF tomorrow???)
