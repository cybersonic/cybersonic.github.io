Since Tiger (OS X 10.4) come out it has a natty feature called Dashboard. The Dash allows you to have a number of mini-applications such as clocks, calculators, weather info etc accessable quickly on your desktop at the push of a button, in my case F12.

I am therefore testing the Dash Blog widget that allows me to post straight to my blog from the dash. neat eh?

I also got the UK train timetables that shows me when trains are leaving and arriving in the UK train stations. Very handy!
