Oh yes, after a couple of months developing some rather interesting applications (from my point of view at any rate) I am back! You remember CFEclipse dont you? I have been beavering away at a few things and doing some admin bits, such as getting all the issues that were stored in the old Issue Tracker in tigris.org over to <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org">http://trac.cfeclipse.org</a>. You might notice that the Beta 2 of CFEclipse 1.3 seems to have a lot of tickets to it? Well that is just a bad import (no, I am not going to put THAT many features in it!... yet)

On another note, I shall be presenting at the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=F222A9C0-F1FF-921E-187AEE9C4C78347D">Thames Valley CFUG</a> on wednesday to show CFEclipse and some of the new features I have been implementing (mainly bug fixes, but if you are still using 1.2 there should be a whole load of new things in there!)

It has been a while since I presented so it should be a blast!

Oh, and keep a look out for a new version of CFeclipse soon (I keep saying that right? I mean it this time!)
