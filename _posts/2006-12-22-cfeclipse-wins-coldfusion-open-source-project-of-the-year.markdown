I just heard (via <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/12/22/2006-ColdFusion-Blog-of-the-Year">Ray's blog</a> as usual) That CFEclipse has won <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2006/12/22/2006-CFeMmys--And-The-Winners-Are">Open Source Project of the Year</a>!

I really would like to thank everyone that has supported the project, people that use it, and everyone that has contributed to it. Next year is definitely going to be a year of releases. The latter part of this year has been filled with admin basically, so that in the new year there will be lots more action!

Thank you all for voting! 

(and Ray, keep on blogging man!)
