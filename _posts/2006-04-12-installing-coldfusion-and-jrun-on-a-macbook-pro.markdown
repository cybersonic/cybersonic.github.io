I didnt have that many problems doing this installation but a number of people have asked me about this, both here and on Sean Corfield's blog.<br /><br />So I have gone through the process and taken pictures along the way so you can work with me :)<br /><br />Check out the <a href="http://web.mac.com/mark.drew/iWeb/CFMX_onMacbook/">Gallery here</a><br />Remember that there is more info on deploying Coldfusion on JRun over at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/j2ee/cfmx-mac-onjrunandtomcat.html#installdeployjrun" target="_blank">Macromedia</a>
