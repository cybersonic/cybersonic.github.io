With all the news about Google censoring china etc etc etc I thought I would post this oddity that was sent to me today (again, just never posted it before)

Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> put in "french military victories" and click "I am feeling lucky"

Astounding results :D
