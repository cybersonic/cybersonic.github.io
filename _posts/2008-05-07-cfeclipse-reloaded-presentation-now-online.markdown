I have put up my CFEclipse Reloaded presentation online for your viewing pleasure under my <a href="/blog/page.cfm/presentations">Presentations</a>. It includes a lot of information on how to edit your frameworks explorer as well as how to fix the language dictionaries if you find errors.

You can check it out there as well as my other presentations or you can <a href="/blog/enclosures/CFEclipse_Reloaded_cfObjective.pdf">download it directly
