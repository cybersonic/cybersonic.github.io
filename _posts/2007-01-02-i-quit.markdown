I have had enough. It has been a couple of years and I am sick of it. The complaints, the cost, everything! I have decided to quit. Thats right, I had made a plan that on  January 1st, 2007 would be my last day, or maybe the first day (depending on your point of view) that I would do this to myself. What am I talking about? No, not CFEclipse! Smoking! Thats right, I have packed the packet in, kicked it in the butt, my smokes have gone up in smoke (actually, I ripped up my last pack and every single cigarette within).

Oh, and happy new year you lot. I am in a grumpy mood. Catch me in a week when I am not trying to bite people's heads off.
