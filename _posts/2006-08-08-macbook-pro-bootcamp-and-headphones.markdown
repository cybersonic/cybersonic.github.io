I am sure a few of you out there have bought a MacBook Pro by now (and if you havent? WHY NOT?!) and installed the BootCamp beta. I have been running my version of Windows XP using BootCamp for a while now, and nearly everything has been sweet. There are a couple of things that nag though, the fact that I cant use my iSight camera (I can live without it to be honest) and the fact that I cant just plug my headphones in. This is a real killer for me since I work in a pretty noisy office, especially now in the summer with all the Aircon units going off. I finally found a solution to make the headphone jack work (without the speakers going off at the same time)

The basic premise is to install updated drivers but there is also a registry change and a config change. The instructions are posted over here <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/apple-macintosh/481247-xp-mac-boot-camp-issue-2.html">http://forums.techguy.org/apple-macintosh/481247-xp-mac-boot-camp-issue-2.html</a> and worked for me on my MacBook Pro 15"

Hope that helps you music lovers out there!
