David Harris just sent me the url of the presentation I did this morning to the <a href="http://www.cfug.co.nz/">Auckland CFUG</a> where I was presenting CFEclipse. If you would like to see the presentation too, just head over to <a href="https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a200985228/p56436186/">https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a200985228/p56436186/</a>
