<p>Liz has posted up a nice big menu of choices for presentation topics at CFUnited 2009. Go cast your vote for the <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/survey/166">ones you like</a> (I am not going to hint that Atomic Reactor and Model Glue and you are my presentations and they will be a LOT of Fun!... oh.. I just mentioned it! Ooops!)</p>
<p>But I was going to ask the reading public the this: Would you be interested in Model Glue/Reactor/ColdSpring training on the day before? Yes, I mean ME running the training! Dont be scared, it will be fun! (that's what <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm">Todd</a> said)</p>
<p>Is one day enough? Maybe you would like a bit more? Or another topic? What would you like to be trained on by me?Â </p>
