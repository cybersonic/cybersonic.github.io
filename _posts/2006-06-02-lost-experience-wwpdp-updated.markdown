Looks like more updates to the Hanso site, although with this one I am a bit confused since it doesnt really do much, even if you head over to the WWP and do the map thing (before you post, yes I know there is a hidden area near Barbados, its been there a while) 

So what is the update? I havent spotted it yet, there is reference to the Mathematical Forecasting Initiative, which I blogged about before.

Will global changes in weather cause population centers to shift? Where are new diseases likely to emerge? Which species need protection now before they begin to decline? The Mathematical Forecasting Initiative uses cutting-edge theory to anticipate the twists and turns of humanity's story. <a href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/#section=wellness">Read more</a>

If anyone spots whats changed, make sure you let me know!
