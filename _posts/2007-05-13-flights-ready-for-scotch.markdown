I have just booked my flights (is it really worth it to go from London to Edinburgh?) to Scotch! 

I shall be getting there on Wednesday night and leaving on Saturday, so its a pretty brief time away, in a way, that is good, allows me to get everything ready for my CFEclipse presentation (more software than presentation) as well as the CF8 AJAX presentation later on in the day.

Now that is 2 reasons you should go to Scotch, nevermind the free beer in the ColdFusion Celebration!

Now to find a hotel (the conference is not in a hotel for a change!)...
