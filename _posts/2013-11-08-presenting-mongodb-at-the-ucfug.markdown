<p>It was my pleasure to be able to present to the largest turnout at the <a href="http://ukcfug.org/">UKCFUG</a> that we have had for a long time last night!Â </p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://twitter.com/grantshepert">Grant Shepert</a> from <a href="http://www.getmura.com/">Mura</a> we did a Google on Air to present MongoDB and <a href="http://www.getmura.com/blog/mura-cms-v61-ready-for-preview/">"What is new in Mura 6.1"</a>, alas due to technical issues Grant couldn't join the Hangout and thus his portion of the video is missing but at least you can see my presentation for MongoDB</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
