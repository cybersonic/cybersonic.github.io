It has been a while since I went to a conference and saw a <a href="http://cfeclipse.org/">CFEclipse</a> presentation. In previous years it has been me presenting on this but since Denny has taken over the development and I have joined <a href="http://www.getrailo.com">Railo</a> time has been short to add to the project and therefore present on the topic. 

<br>
<br>
So we are starting a donation fund for Denny to attend <a href="http://www.opencfsummit.org/">http://www.opencfsummit.org/</a>! It will be an amazing conference and I think the missing piece of the puzzle is the current Developer of CFEclipse presenting! So head over to <a href="http://cfeclipse.org/index.cfm/blog/dengocon/">http://cfeclipse.org/index.cfm/blog/dengocon/</a> and show your support!

Go on, you know it makes sense.
