So I am presuming since we are <a href="http://www.letyourcompassguideyou.com/" target="_blank">following the compass</a> all the way to 108 degress, and the code is there, and it must refer to the Swan Station. Of course, following the compass leads you to Hugh McIntyre's email box to basically the password that you can use on his profile.<br /><br />What next I ask you? well, I think we are working our way through the Directors. Persephone has obviously hacked the site and is trying to show us what the Foundation is really about<br /><br />I am still seeing how I can get into Peter Thompson's secret. The rest of the board is all password protected and I think each one of their profiles will be accessed in time.</p>
