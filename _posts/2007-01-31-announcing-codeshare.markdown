Have you ever been in the position that you had some code that wouldn't do something? You wanted to show it to someone, so you cut and paste the code (bye bye formatting) and email it... great... but what if you could do this straight from your editor?


Announcing the <a href="http://codeshare.ulatu.com/">codeShare</a> project! This is a new website by <a href="http://ev.instantspot.com/blog/index.cfm">Ryan Everhart</a>, <a href="http://fro.instantspot.com">Robert Froehling</a> (and <a href="http://daveshuck.instantspot.com/blog/">Dave Shuck</a>  and <a href="http://ajlcom.instantspot.com/blog/">Aaron Lynch</a> on the InstantSpot integration) allows you to post a code fragment and it returns a private URL that you can share with others and comment on the code.

You might ask why I am announcing this (apart from it being a damned useful service)? Well, over the last couple of weeks I have written a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/codeshareplugin/">plugin</a> for this service that works straight from your IDE of choice, Eclipse!

So now <a href="http://codeshare.ulatu.com/">codeShare</a> also works with Eclipse, standalone and with InstantSpot! 

Check out <a href="http://ev.instantspot.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/31/codeShares-New-Home-and-New-Features">Ryan's post for more details</a> on codeShare


Of course, you could also watch a <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/markdrew/CodeShareDemo.mov" target="_blank">little video</a> I made (no sound) on how to use it.


You can get the plugin from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/codeshareplugin/">codeSharePlugin</a> website
