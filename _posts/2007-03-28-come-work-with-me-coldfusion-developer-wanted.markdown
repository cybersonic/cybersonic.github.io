The job details and requirements are:

This position is based in our London (Piccadilly) offices and its an on-site position (sorry, no remote workers) and you will of course need a EU Work Permit.

Needless to say, no agencies please!

(Before you ask, the salary is pretty damn good, &pound;30-34K + bonus + benefits, and you get to work on some really exciting stuff!)
