As has been mentioned <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm">elsewhere</a> in the <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2007/1/5/In-London-January-1216--Want-to-say-hi">blogsphere</a>, the unstoppable blogging machine that is <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm">Peter Bell</a> and the quiet and demure <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog">Andy Allan</a> will both be  down in London (yes! England!) next Monday (15th) and we thought instead of having the usual CFUG thing, we would do an informal drink + place the face + shop talk gathering of sorts down in <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/review_1619.html">Point 101, 101 New Oxford Street, WC1A 1DD</a> (if you dont know where this is, head to Tottenham Court Rd Station and look for the REALLY bloody tall building... its at the base of that).

Come all, come be merry (or any other emotional state you choose).

See you there?
