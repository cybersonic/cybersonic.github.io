Has redesigned its site.. hmm.. interesting... <br /><br /><a href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/" target="_blank">http://www.thehansofoundation.org/</a><br /><br />I wonder what happens if you put &quot;breakingstrain&quot; in the newsletter section?<br /><br />Ahh the summer voyage beguins! Also well done Joop on getting to 105... hold on...&nbsp; do you think the will make it to 2 + 8 + 15 + 16 + 23 + 42?<br /><br /><br />Of course the TV adverts for the foundation before the screening of the first episodes of season 2 might have been &quot;lost&quot; on British audiences since, they have just found out what is in the hatch.... ahh those days of the idealistic Lock.<br /><br />Another thing, did you spot that once Desmond appeared in Jack's running life, people who couldnt walk got all better?<br />
