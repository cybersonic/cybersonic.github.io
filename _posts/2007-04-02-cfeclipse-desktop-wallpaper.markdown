<a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/assets/desktops/cfeclipse.png"><img src="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/images/cfeclipse_wallpaper.png" border="0" align="left"></a> Maybe some of you noticed over at CFEclipse TV that I had a CFEclipse Desktop Wallpaper in the background. I thought I would make it available to everyone, you can crop it if you like... Its mainly for my MacBook Pro.

Let me know what you think!

(get it while its... rectangular!)
