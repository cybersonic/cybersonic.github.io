At the <a href="http://localhost.fm">Localhost Podcast</a> we are trying another format which we are calling the <code>Develop Branch</code> where we can do some experiments outside of the main show's format! 

We have a new episode ready, in which we talk with Geoff Bowers about docker! Super interesting talk with a very clever man! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/localhostfm/localhost-podcast-episode-001-1">Go Listen Now!</a>
