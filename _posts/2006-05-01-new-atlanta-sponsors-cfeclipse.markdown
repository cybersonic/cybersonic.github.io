Thats right, we have a sponsor, in a very real &quot;hard-cash&quot; kind of way from <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/" target="_blank">New Atlanta</a>, makers of BlueDragon. <br /><br />New Atlanta sponsored the ability to have multiple tag dictionaries (including of course a Blue Dragon one) and choosing different dictionaries per project.&nbsp; A&nbsp; very useful feature indeed and just the kind of sponsorship that propels development of CFEclipse. This means that per project you get validation of your code against a version of CFML that you have chosen for that project. This will highlight any errors that you have with your code for that version of ColdFusion<br /><br />This means that finally we have some hard-cash that will be well spent on the project (watch this space and <a href="http://cfeclipse.org" target="_blank">cfeclipse.org </a>for more news in the next couple of weeks) and promoting CFEclipse.<br /><br /><br />Very exciting news indeed!<br /><br /><br />PS. sorry about the multiple edits, I havent upgraded to the latest version of <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com" target="_blank">blogCFC</a> so I cant write drafts!
