Those clever bods at Google have been at it again. Now for your entertainment and chatting convenience comes <a href="http://talk.google.com">Google Talk</a>!:

They say:
<blockquote>Google Talk enables you to call or send instant messages to your friends for free????????anytime, anywhere in the world.</blockquote>

It runs on Jabber so you can connect to it from iChat on OS X for example which is superb!

Will this force other IM systems to also open up?
