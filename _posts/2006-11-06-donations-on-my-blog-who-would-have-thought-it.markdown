Ok, so I have given in, I dont know whether it is evil or good, but I have added a "Donate" button to my blog (can be seen in the Wishlist Pod on the right here, nifty button and all).

If any donations do come through (a guy can hope can't he?) the funds will be used for travel to the forthcoming <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/">CFUnited</a> and <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cfObjective</a> conferences, not to mention Scotch on the Rocks in Scotland (you just HAVE to go to that one, sell your grannie, its going to be lots of fun!)

Otherwise, time to put a lot of my old books on eBay!!!

Anyone for an old copy of Terry Pratchett's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sisters-Discworld-Novel-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0552134600/sr=8-9/qid=1162824788/ref=pd_ka_9/202-5218834-0604624?ie=UTF8&s=books">Wyrd Sisters</a> only slightly battered and very few JD and Coke stains?
