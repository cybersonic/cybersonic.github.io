Even thought I was late, and the room we had booked had no air-con  I actually enjoyed last night's presentation on ColdSpring and Model Glue 2.0: Unity. There wasnt a major turn out (about 12 people) but considering we had to re-schedule it twice it was pretty good!

I did promise to make my presentation available and this time I didnt bother recording it (takes so long afterwards to make the podcast with the slide presentations etc, I must find a better way of being able to record a presentation, images + voice and then switch to video+voice for the demos.)
