<a href="http://www.postsecret.blogspot.com/">PostSecret</a>: "PostSecret is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard."

This is a great blog I stumbled upon that has a number of postcards with people sharing secrets with the world via home-made postcards. Some funny, some disturbing but definately all interesting.
