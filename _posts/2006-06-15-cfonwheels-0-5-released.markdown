What a day for framework releases!! <a href="http://www.cfwheels.com/weblog/entry/15">ColdfFusion on Wheels</a> has just reached 0.5 status and it comes with a great new set of features such as scaffolding, better render() methods, IIS support and finders. 

It also has support for IIS which I think would be a big thing in helping its more commercial use (I know I am a Mac guy but enough CF installations run on Windows and IIS)

I cant comment on its use just yet but it is a great time to get hooked onto Frameworks!

Another thing that Rob Cameron commented was that CFonWheels is probably the first framework that relies on Application.cfc which is very interesting as its the first framework aimed at ColdFusion 7.  About time too!
