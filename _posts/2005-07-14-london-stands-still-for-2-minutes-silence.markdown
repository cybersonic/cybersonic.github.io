The spooky thing for me is that this is the second time I have seen this in as many years. Last year I was living in Valencia, Spain when the Madrid bombings happened and I saw how people reacted to that. London seems to have the same defiant spirit and today's midday silence just shows that.

Its guerrilla warfare all over again but the only way to combat this is to hold firm to our behavior and show that idiotic attacks such as these do nothing but make the community become more united. 

It is obvious that these attacks are done by such small minded people, I read that they are "foot soldiers" of Al-Qaeda but they are nothing more than fodder. The ones we need to hit back are the leaders. Obvious really but they hide like terrified little children. Is that the kind of "cause" you would want to follow?
