Yesterday when I got home I had a nice little surprise, I got a couple of <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cfeclipse">CFEclipse T-shirts</a> waiting for me at home!

I must say its awesome to have these, and I got the t-shirt made out of american cotton and its fantastic.. really nice feel!

Even though I designed them, I now CAN recomend them, very good quality!
