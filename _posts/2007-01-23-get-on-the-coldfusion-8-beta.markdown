Posted over at <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/22/Anyone-Want-To-Beta-Test-Scorpio">Ben Forta's blog</a>, you, yes YOU, can finally get onto the <a href="https://prerelease.adobe.com/callout/apply.html?callid=\{E9F64ADB-DADA-485E-BFFE-60E0D783EBEF}">ColdFusion 8 Beta</a> program!

I dont know what this does to NDA's so I am sure as more people get on there will be more of a buzz on the features it has (apart from the ones that have already been shown at various conferences already)

So go <a href="https://prerelease.adobe.com/callout/apply.html?callid=\{E9F64ADB-DADA-485E-BFFE-60E0D783EBEF}">check it out</a>!
