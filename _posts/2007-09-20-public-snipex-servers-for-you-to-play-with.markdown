I just wanted to note down some public SnipEx server addresses that are out there just to remind myself as well as hopefully helping others:<ul>
	<li>CFEclipse's own SnipEx Server: <input type="text" readonly="true" size="50" value="http://www.cfeclipse.org/snipex/snipex.cfc"></li>
	<li>CFLib.org's SnipEx Server: <input type="text" readonly="true" size="50" value="http://cflib.org/snipex/snipex.cfc"></li>
	<li>Todd Sharp's CFSnippets SnipEx Server: <input type="text" readonly="true" size="50" value="http://www.cfsnippets.org/model/snippets/snipEx/snipEx.cfc"></li>
</ul>

I hope that helps!
