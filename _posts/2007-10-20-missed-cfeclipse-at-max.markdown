If you missed my CFEclipse presentation at Adobe MAX Barcelona,  Jo√£o Fernandes has been kind enough to post up a video of my whole presentation!

You can check it out here: <a href="http://www.onflexwithcf.org/index.cfm/2007/10/20/Using-Eclipse-for-ColdFusion-Development--Videos">http://www.onflexwithcf.org/index.cfm/2007/10/20/Using-Eclipse-for-ColdFusion-Development--Videos</a>

I had some problems getting the debugger working, and I realised later that it was simply that I named my project wrong and should have set up the mappings.

Hope you enjoy it!
