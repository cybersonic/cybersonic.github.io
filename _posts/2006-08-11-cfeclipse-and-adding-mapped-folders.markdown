In Eclipse you can add a folder to your project that is mapped to another folder in the file system. Coldfusion developers are used to this concept as ColdFusion server allows you to create mappings. Sometimes it is useful to create a linked folder in your project, such as for CustomTags or a mapping to a framework. In this video I show you how to do that. Quick simple, yet oddly effective.
