This has to be the most active/lucky day of my life, <a href="http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/">Matt Woodward </a>has made a donation that really gets me close to getting enough funds to get the laptop fixed.

Matt, apart from being a super bloke and smart fella, does the <a href="http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/">ColdFusion Weekly podcast</a> that if you are not listening to it already, it is a must.

Thank you man! Totally appreciated!
