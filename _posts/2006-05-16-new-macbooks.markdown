It was just a matter of time for Apple to release the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html" target="_blank">MacBooks </a>wasnt it?<br /><br />Nice little machines in black or white (like the iPod) with 2Gz chips and price ranging from $1,099 to&nbsp; $1,499 (thats &pound;749 to &pound;1028 in real money) with of course intel inside and all the gubbins. I am surprised by these machines too! They have iSight built in as well as audio in and out (my old iBook didnt have that!) <br /><br />Very nice spec for a pretty cheap machine. Just a smaller screen than my MacBook Pro.<br /><br />Now, to wait for the G5 equivalent, I wonder what they will call it? Just Mac?
