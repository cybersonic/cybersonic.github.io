<p>Here is how I do it, I add a contact form to my website from a nice service called <a href="http://wufoo.com/">http://wufoo.com/</a> and then I forget to mail them to myself. </p>
<p>So what do I have now?  A year's worth of contacts that I have ignored. So apologies there! Since I am now using <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/">Mango Blog</a>, it comes with a nice plugin to do <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/docs/plugins/formToEmail">FormToEmail</a> that you just have to enable and put simple tokens in that create a nice form, which sends an email. Does what it says on the tin eh?!</p>
<p>So, without further ado, you can actually now contact me over at the <a href="/blog/page.cfm/contact">new intelligent form</a>! (Intelligent since I am not!)</p>
