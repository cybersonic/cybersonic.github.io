Just a quick update that if you are interested in the EventGuard project, want to make some additions/modifications or even if you have found some bugs, I have just checked in the code and posted the zip over at the <a href="http://eventguard.riaforge.org/" title="EventGuard">EventGuard Project</a> page on <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/" title="Welcome to RIAForge">RiaForge</a>

Any feedback is appreciated!
