Once again we have managed (not) to come up with an excuse to have a drink, this time, we didn't even bother coming up with an new excuse and used an old one instead: Andy Allan is back down in London which means its time for another CF_DRINKS!

This is where we get down and dirty and talk cf tech and drink some fermented liquids.

The details are as follows:
