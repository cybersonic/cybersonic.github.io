How is that for a version number frenzy?

I have just put CFEclipse 1.3.1.5 up on the update site (http://www.cfeclipse.org/update) which you should have in your Eclipse Update sites.

Give it a whirl, it should now work nicely (or as much as I can test) with Eclipse 3.3

With testing in mind, I wonder how many people would be up for being testers of each release? 

A tester would have a set number of features to test for each version/operating system, and would make my job of hunting down bugs a lot easier!

Anyway, have fun! And happy Fourth of July! (how to release something when its quiet eh?)
