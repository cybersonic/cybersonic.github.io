I just wanted to say a big thanks to Joe FitzGerald, after a bit of problems with Amazon claiming I refused a delivery (ME? REFUSE?!), he managed to get me an Amazon Gift-Voucher. This gift voucher has been put to a very good use!

Firstly I managed to get <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321334612/202-5218834-0604624">Eclipse Rich Client Platform: Designing, Coding, and Packaging Java Applications</a>. This was a book to complete my collection (well nearly, I also want to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-SWT-JFace/dp/1590593251/sr=1-1/qid=1164275403/ref=sr_1_1/202-5218834-0604624?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">The Definitive Guide to SWT and JFace</a> since I am terrible at understanding how to do GUI stuff in Java ) of Eclipse based books. The other ones I have are <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eclipse-Building-Commercial-Quality-Eric-Clayberg/dp/032142672X/sr=1-6/qid=1164275493/ref=sr_1_6/202-5218834-0604624?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality Plug-Ins</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Contributing-Eclipse-Principles-Patterns-Plugins/dp/0321205758/sr=11-1/qid=1164275539/ref=sr_11_1/202-5218834-0604624">Contributing to Eclipse: Principles, Patterns and Plugins</a>, both of which are highly recommended, the first to understand how to build plugins (a definite boon!) and the second to understand the libraries in Eclipse.

I am looking forward to the Eclipse RCP book as I am thinking of doing a "mini" version of CFEclipse which would (hopefully!) allow you to double click and edit cfm and cfc files (if at all possible, it has been a bug in Eclipse for about 4 years) but we shall see.

The other book I got with the voucher was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/071563318X/202-5218834-0604624">The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead</a> which is a book no one should be without. You never know when the dead might rise up again and we have to keep them in check. 

So thanks Joe! Very much appreciated!!!

Have a great Thanksgiving all of you in the US of A!
