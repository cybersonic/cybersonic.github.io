<p>Coming up this Thursday 25th of September, the "<a href="http://www.aweedram.com/ofScotch/">a Wee Dram of Scotch</a>" one day conference is taking place in London.</p>
<p>This is a great replacement to the cancelled <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">CFDevCon</a> that was meant to be happening over in Brighton, but alas didn't for various reasons. Which brings to mind whether we should have more conferences like this, one day, very cheap (at Â£10 for entry its surely the cheapest conference there is!) but with still some awesome speakers such as <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm">Sean Corfield</a>, <a href="http://www.pbell.com/">Peter Bell</a> and<a href="http://www.cfwhisperer.com/"> Mike Brunt</a>, not to mention <a href="http://www.adrocknaphobia.com/">Adam Lehman</a> from Adobe doing the keynote! </p>
<p>So what do you think? Should there be more one day conferences? Would you like your CFUG to cover this instead? More cheap (or free) training in your locality?</p>
<p>Also, how would we expand the use of CF? Is this a good medium for this?</p>
<p>Would love to hear people's opinions on this.</p>
