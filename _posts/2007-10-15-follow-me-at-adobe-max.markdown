Its 6:50 am before the first day of Adobe Max and I am sitting in my hotel room, without internet connection (they say that it will be fixed in the hotel today, pah!) and just getting ready to head to the Barcelona Inernational Conference Center.

If I manage to get a good internet connection over at the conference center, I shall try to be <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twittering</a> my progress as much as I can. 

You can follow my progress on my <a href="http://twitter.com/markdrew" title="Twitter / markdrew">twitter page</a>
