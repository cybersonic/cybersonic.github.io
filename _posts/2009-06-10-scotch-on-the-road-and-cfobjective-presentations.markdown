<p>A few people have asked me to post my presentations, and I should have done so anyway straight after the conferences, but of course, since I did three presentations + a Mystery Theatre at <a title="cf.Objective()" href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cfobjective</a> and four presentations at <a title="Scotch on the Road 2009 - Europe's Longest Running ColdFusion Conference" href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/">Scotch on the Road</a> I have been falling behind normal work and blog postings.</p>
<p>So, here for your delectation are all the presentations for you to download... (apart from the Mystery Theatre 3000 since that has a naughty picture in it)
