Well, I had some time to look round the Hanso Foundation site again and under the Worldwide Wellness and Prevention Development Programme I noticed that if you go to the Press Release section and you click on the word "miracle" it asks you for a password, I am sure its related to the previous clue about the Mathematical Forecasting Initiative. Anyone have any clues?
