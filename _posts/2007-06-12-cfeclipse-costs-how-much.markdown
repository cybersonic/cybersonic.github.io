I just joined a site called <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">OHLOH</a> and added the <a href="">CFEclipse project</a> to its listing which does some code checking and finds usernames etc and says how much work they do on the porject (I presume by commits etc)

I know its not completely acurate but if you wanted to buy CFEclipse, well, you have to pay me somwhere in the region of $3 Million dollars (now, why do I feel like Dr. Evil when I say that?)


Some fun stats:

UPDATE: Since I added the old repository, this has gone up to nearly $6Million! Spike, Rob and Oliver were really busy at one time!
