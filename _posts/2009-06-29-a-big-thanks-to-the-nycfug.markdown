<p>This weekend I got a package in the post, with an awesome t-shirt from the NYCFUG! I want to thank <a href="http://www.clarkvalberg.com/">Clark Valberg</a> and <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/">Ben Nadel</a> from <a href="http://www.epicenterconsulting.com/">Epicenter Consulting</a> for sending me such an awesome item as well as for the fantastic reception I had at the NYCFUG in May! </p>
