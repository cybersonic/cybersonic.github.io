Ok, a bad put for a headline, but I have to give a massive thank you to <a href="http://clearsoftware.net/">Joe Rinehart.</a> His <a href="http://www.model-glue.com">Model Glue</a> framework has literally saved my bacon this week.&nbsp; He also gave me some great pointers over the last three days, standard stuff really but during the heat of battle he clarified how it should work very nicely.<br /><br />I have done my first commercial (i,e. paid for by a client at work) application in Model Glue. For this application (I cant say who its for or much about what it does yet) I had estimated would take me 5 to 7 days to build. Unfortunately another project got in the way and I had a hard deadline for this project which left me with THREE days to build it. I used MG and Reactor for this applicaiton, starting on wednesday and I got it finished, with tweaks and testing by friday at 6pm, with enough time to go down the pub.<br /><br />The experience of being able to do a well structured, documented application in three days, all the while knowing you havent &quot;Kludged&quot; or put things together with bits of string to make the deadline is a very good sensation.<br /><br />So a massive hats of to <a href="http://clearsoftware.net/">Joe Rinehart</a> and also to <a href="http://www.doughughes.net">Doug Hughes</a> for the two frameworks that are a REAL time saver.<br /><br />On a side note, I made some modifications to <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> as I mentioned before, and even though they are not production ready or fully featured, the component insight has helped a hell of a lot with this project.
