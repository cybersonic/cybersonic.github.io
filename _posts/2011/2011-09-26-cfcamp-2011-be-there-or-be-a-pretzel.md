<p>Munich! City of Oktober fest and Pretzels! The big soft ones with butter inside. What could be more delicious than that? I tell you what is... CFCAMP 2011 is! </p>
<p>That's right ladies and gentle-folks, after a three year hiatus, there is going to be a stomping and knowledge-infusing conference in Munich this year, filled to the gills with awesome presenters and me! </p>
<p>For a measly €90  a ticket (going up to €119 in October, so get them whilst they are fresh!), your mind can be blown by the likes of Charlie Arehart (he of the inside secrets into ColdFusion 10!), Luis Majano (he of the mobile knowledge), Gary Gilbert exposing his JQuery to the public, Bilal Soylu will also be locking down your apps, and of course Andy Allan and myself, giving it all from our presenter's pulpit. </p>
<p>Sure you can't miss this?!</p>
<p>Head over to <del><a href="http://www.cfcamp.org/anmeldung.cfm">http://www.cfcamp.org/anmeldung.cfm</a></del><a href="http://www.cfcamp.org/registration.cfm?ChangeLanguageTo=en"> http://www.cfcamp.org/registration.cfm?ChangeLanguageTo=en</a> to get your tickets (<del>yep, it's in German, just use Chrome and translate it, you are a clever person right?</del> This time in English! Don't say we don't spoil you!)</p>
