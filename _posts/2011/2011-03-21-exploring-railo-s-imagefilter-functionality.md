One of the new functions that will be introduced in Railo 3.3 is the ImageFilter() function. This is one hell of a function with a LOT of parameters, so I thought rather than create some massive documentation index for it, I would make something a little but more fun; so introducing The Image Filter Explorer!

<p>
This small application allows you to explore the different filters you can use against an image, and see the result, along with a code sample of how to do that particular function.
