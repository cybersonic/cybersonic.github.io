<p>As an "owner" of a blog, that has (at last count) 590 posts dating back over seven years, I noticed that I start getting a lot of comment spam. </p>
<p>I have been asking myself, how long should I allow comments on blog posts? I mean, I am sure I posted something in 2006 that might be relevant again, but maybe just contact me? Since I doubt someone is going through my archives (unless they got there via Google of course) and even then, since this is a technology blog, I am sure there are a lot of things that are now out of date. </p>
<p>So the question is, should I turn off comments on blog posts that are older than X time? and what should that X be?</p>
<p>Over to you!</p>
