It has been two years today that I have been working at Railo Technologies and it gives me great pleasure to announce that Denny Valliant (<a href="http://twitter.com/denstar">@denstar</a>) has just joined the team! 
</p

<p>
Denny is a great addition as he has been working with various packagers for Railo, and of course, he is the Lead Developer for the CFEclipse project!

How about that for a great combination eh?!

Welcome on board Denny! Hold on tight! It's gonna be a hell of a ride!
