So far today I have deleted 4 instances of comment spam. These people are actually getting past the captcha code and entering things in, so I presume they are human. I delete them as soon as I can of course but what is retarded (for these people ARE retarded, evil and they smell pretty bad, not to mention ugly) they are putting in a URL that doesnt exist. So right, Miss/Mr  Spammer, you are putting in the URL of your site, but it doesnt exist. Bogg off please, its just a waste of your time. Surely???
