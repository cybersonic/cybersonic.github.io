Last week I was delighted to be invited to do a presentation to the <a href="http://www.clevelandmmug.org/?group=cfug">Cleveland CFUG</a>. 

The presentation was about CFEclipse and luckily enough they recoreded the Adobe Connecto (still cant get used to that name... I didnt mind Breezo, but Connecto??) which, if you are interested, you can check out here: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p51917266/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p51917266/</a>
