Whoa, and double whoaaaa...  Apple do it again, a simple darn idea. You want your itunes playing on your stereo in the garage, you dont want to take your expensive iBook or Pc down there, what do you do? you take airport express, plug it into a mains socket, plug the speakers in and send your tunes from the living room. What an absolutely amazing idea!
