I seem to be getting comment spam on this blog of late. Very interesting comments of course but all linking to something. A bit daft since the whole point of doing that is to get higher search engine rankings... but they wont get that since each post that has a link gets a nofollow attribute and thus not doing anything for the page ranking!

So, to slow that down a little at least I have implemented word verification when posting, at least that should slow the spammers down a little!

Sorry for the inconvenience if you REALLY wanted to post  a comment here but the traffic is so slow that I dont think that will bother anyone!
