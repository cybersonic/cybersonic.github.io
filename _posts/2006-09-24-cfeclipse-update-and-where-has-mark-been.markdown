Some of you might have noticed that I havent been posting a lot recently (and others might have noticed I havent even been emailing back a lot!) but basically I have been very busy at work and that has taken over everything over the last few weeks. The project I have been working on is finally live and before I start on the next project  (which will keep me as busy as the last for the next month at least) I have been doing some CFEclipse development. This weekend I have been working on a new feature as well as moving all the issues that used to be hosted on tigris.org to <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org">trac.cfeclipse.org</a> so if you are wondering what was happening to that bug/feature you posted, well now you know that we are again on top of it and I shall be sorting out the issues into the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/roadmap">roadmap</a> (which is looking very full but that is because in the import they all got assigned to Beta 2).

I hope to be back on the case with blog posts to keep you up to date a bit more!

Besides that I shall be presenting all the updates of CFEclipse over at  <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">http://www.cfdevcon.com/</a> on November the 9th, the first coldfusion developer convention I have been to in the UK, I definately recomend people to come over and check it out!
