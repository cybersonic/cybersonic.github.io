I added the ASK MD pod on my blog so people could get in touch with me easily, the idea being that I could write them back as a blog post (hence I dont ask their email etc) but I noticed that by having "ASK MD" I have been getting some rather strange questions of a medical nature. Now, I am quite knowledgeable in ColdFusion, CFEclipse, Java, Web Development in general and other random things (like Lost plotlines etc) but some of the questions I cant answer. So sorry folks, if you have come here to ask me how many quaaludes it takes to get you high or other much more *intimate* questions... I am not your type of MD.

And seriously... dont you read *anything* on the blog before posting?!
