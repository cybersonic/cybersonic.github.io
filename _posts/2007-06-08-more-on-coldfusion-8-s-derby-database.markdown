A couple of links (just for my own reference really) on some useful tips on using Derby:

<a href="http://steve.coldfusionjournal.com/using_the_derby_database.htm">Steve Bryant at Coldfusion Journal</a>

and good ole <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/29/More-On-Scorpio-And-Apache-Derby">Ben Forta</a>

(apologies if this is repeating other people's stuff, its mainly for my brain)
