<p>After the summer hiatus which is essentially the conference season, the <a title="UKCFUG | The UK ColdFusion User Group" href="http://www.ukcfug.org/">UKCFUG is back</a>! And its better than ever! 
<br />
We have got a new site up, in blog format so you can easily subscribe to news of meetings and other events. There is also an awesome meeting planned for the 6th of November.</p>
<p>We are testing the waters with a new format, we have a new segment at each meeting called "CF Docs" (like CF Doctors, gettit?) in which you can ask the panel of myself, Niklas Richardson, Neil Middleton and Big Mad Kev any CF based questions (and some Flex ones!). </p>
<p>Hopefully if no technical issues happen we shall be recording the segment and turn it into a podcast, something like a "<a title="Gardeners' Question Time - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardener%27s_Question_Time">Gardener's Question Time</a>" for CF. </p>
<p>So whether you are planning on attending or will catch up via the podcast, send us your questions via email and we shall read them out. The email for the questions is
<script type="text/javascript"></script>
or leave a comment here or on the UK CFUG website. </p>
<p>Neil will also be giving us a preview of his <a title="Adobe MAX 2008 - Europe" href="http://max.adobe.com/eu/experience/">Adobe MAX Conference</a> talk "Structuring your development team and getting the work done" which should be awesome! </p>
<p>So whether you can make it on the 6th, or just want some answers to your questions, get registered on the UKCFUG website! </p>
<p>
It's going to be a great season!</p>
