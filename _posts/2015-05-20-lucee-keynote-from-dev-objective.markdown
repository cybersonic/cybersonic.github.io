The [Lucee Association Switzerland](http://lucee.org/) (LAS for short) has published the awesome [keynote](http://lucee.org/blog/lucee-keynote-dev-objective.html ) that [Geoff Bowers](https://twitter.com/modius) from [Daemon](http://www.daemon.com.au/) gave at the [dev.objective()](http://www.devobjective.com/) conference.

Being there in person for it, I have to say it is was an entertaining, emotional and hopeful presentation that really makes the future look good for Lucee and CFML developers (with some changes if they want to to the new Lucee dialect)
