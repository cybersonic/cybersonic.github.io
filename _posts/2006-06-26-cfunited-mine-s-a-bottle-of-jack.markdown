Hooray, well, one last working day and then I am heading out to CFUnited tomorrow (arriving at 3pm at Ray-Gun Intl airport) and then heading to the Ramada Inn which will be my temporary abode during the conference, and then on monday I head out to San Francisco for another week staying at... The Ramada Inn (downtown aparently!)

I am really looking forward to this conference, my first of this kind, and just going nuts with last minute preparation (how many millions of dollars I can buy with 3 British Pounds etc). There are a couple of things that fill me with Fear and Loathing though about this trip, and that is my hobbies of drinking and smoking... and where will I be able to get a bottle of Jack?!

Anyone getting to Ray-Gun around 3pm on Tue?
