We am finally here in wet, wet Rockville. Checked into the Ramada Inn (room 202 if you ask, but not here for long)

Managed to get some smokes in the 7-11 (I know this is normal for you americans but as a americana fan-boy this was an awesome experience... I got WIDE Camel Lights.. go figure!)

Absolutely shattered, we left home at about 8:40 am GMT and checked into the hotel at about 7:40pm EST (thats a round 16 hour trip if you are counting) so I think we are going to grab some dinner and then meet everyone up in the Marriot tomorrow morning (a bit fresher hopefully than I feel now!)

I cant belive it took so long to get here... and we are still trying to find that bottle of JD!

See you all tomorrow!!!
