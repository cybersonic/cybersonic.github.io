I noticed, that even though our blurb a while back for the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" title="CFEclipse: The ColdFusion IDE for Eclipse">CFEclipse</a> project said it was one of the top rated plugins on http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/, our rating has dropped quite a lot. To stop this tragic state of affairs, I wonder if user's of CFEclipse would mind voting on it at the following sites:


<a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-req-viewlink-cid-175.html" title="Eclipse Plugin Central :: Eclipse plugin resource center and marketplace for Eclipse and Plugin Ecosystem">http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/</a>

and

<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5939" title="CFEclipse - Ohloh, the open source network">http://www.ohloh.net/</a>

It would be great to give it a good ranking wouldn't it?


(just a suggestion you understand)
