So, I am all packed, sipping the last of the coffee, about to leave in a few seconds to Gatwick to head to CFUnited 2007!

I am really looking forward to this conference, it should be a blast! 

Those that can't make it this year, I promise, I shall try and blog and take as many photos as possible to keep you all in the loop.

(ahh, promises promises!).

So without further ado, see you on the other side of the pond!
