I have just put up an update site to test whether I can deploy both CFEclipse 1.2 and CFEclipse 1.3 Beta via the update site. I have been getting some strange results and I wonder if people out there could test the update site?

To do so, in Eclipse, go to Help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install ->  Search for new features to install -> New Remote Site. Then you can put the name as "CFEclipse (beta)" (if you like) and then put the following address: http://www.markdrew.co.uk/betaupdate

In theory you should see Bleeding Edge and Stable versions, I am getting only the Bleeding Edge appearing for some reason... hence I need testers with different versions of Eclipse. 

Let me know what you get, what version of Eclipse you are running and (if you feel like downloading, this is the bleeding edge of 1.3 RC 1)
