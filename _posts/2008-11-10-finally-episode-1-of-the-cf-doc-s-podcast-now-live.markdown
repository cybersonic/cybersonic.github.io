It took me a while to edit it and we had some problems with the microphones on the night so it was recorded straight from the laptop, thus you can't hear the audience very well. Next time I promise we shall have our mic's all sorted out and it will be of much better quality, that said, I don't think it's too bad considering the situation!</span></p>
