I wanted to put down (for the help of new Switchers and myself) a list of applications I consider a top 10 of commercial (have to pay) applications for OS X. There are so many applications that are free on the Mac, that cover nearly everything you want to do, but for this post I wanted to cover some of the paid for applications.

I know there are Open Source alternatives for most of this software, but sometimes there is just software that *IS* worth the few pounds/dollars/euros that it takes to buy them. 

Please bear in mind, that I am a web developer (or application developer depending on the time of day) so these are focused on what I do. So without further ado here is my list (in no particular order):

<strong>1) TextMate <a href="http://macromates.com/">http://macromates.com/</a> &euro 39</strong>

This is the "Missing Text Editor" for the Mac. I use this all the time, and there is a CFML plugin for it, for when you need to edit those random CFML files. Obviously for projects I use <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>, but a text editor is always a handy tool

<strong>2) QuickTime Pro <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/</a> &pound; 20</strong>

QuickTime already comes with OS X but what you really want is the very cheap Pro edition, if only to watch stuff in full screen, and not to mention its export capabilities! 

<strong>3) Parallels <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/</a> $79.99 /VMWare Fusion <a href="http://www.vmware.com/beta/fusion/">http://www.vmware.com/beta/fusion/</a>
$ 39.99 (for pre-orders)</strong>

With the advent of the IntelMacs, we can now run Windows natively or in Virtualisation, so these are the best (maybe only) tools for the job!

I classify both of these as one since they do the same job (I have been checking out VMWare Fusion for a few weeks using my BootCamp drive, and I am really enjoying it, it seems faster than Parallels)

Don't boot up your Mac without at least one of these!


<strong>4) iWork <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">http://www.apple.com/iwork/</a> $79</strong>

I do a lot of presentations and <strong>the</strong> best software for that is <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, it just runs rings round PowerPoint (now if only <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatconnectpro/">Adobe Connect</a> would support either PDF or Keynote files!!)

I dont use <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a> as much, but its still a lot nicer than the interface-cluttering Microsoft Word.

<strong>5) Coda <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">http://www.panic.com/coda/</a> $69</strong>

We all have some small sites to manage, and Coda, a new kid on the block brings in some real nice features for this. I think its worth it alone for the CSS and the Site panel (which it automatically creates thumbnails of your sites!) I haven't bought this yet, but I am really liking it.
EDIT: the latest version of Coda supports CFML too.
<strong>6) Adobe Fireworks CS3 <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/">http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/</a> $299</strong>

I am not a designer but I love Fireworks. I have been using it for years and its the best web graphic design software I have used. I know Adobe Photoshop is the daddy but the ability to do everything web design related in one package (down to creating the HTML for you) is just too good. I love this app!


<strong>7) Aqua Data Studio <a href="http://www.aquafold.com/">http://www.aquafold.com/</a> $399</strong>

There are apps for every database out there, but if you are connecting to a variety of databases this rules. Unfortunately because of the price I have to install Windows and use Microsoft MSSQL Enterprise Manager, but if I could afford this, Windows would end up just being a shell for Internet Explorer. This is a must if you do a lot of database work.

(Aqua Data Studio v4.7 is actually free, but it doesn't have all the features I would like it to have)

<strong>8) OmniGraffle <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/</a> from $79</strong>

If you are doing a lot of diagrams, be they UML to system architecture, OmniGraffle makes it really nice with very impressive results. 


<strong>9) OmniPlan <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/</a> $149.95</strong>

I always hated Microsoft Project, there is something evil about it (maybe just because I am a developer) but when I had a go on Omni Plan, I thought "hey, I *CAN* get into project management!". As with OmniGraffle its results are impressive as well as pretty, and hey, if you are going to be staring at something all day, you might as well be staring at something good right?


<strong>10) Delicious Library <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">http://www.delicious-monster.com/</a> $40</strong>

This is a great little tool if you have lots of DVD's (and books) as well as appreciative friends who like borrowing them. The main thing about this is that you can very easily create a whole library of your DVD's simply by scanning the bar-code using your iSight camera. You can then have a list of who you have lent out your DVD's too as well as loads more info and suggestions (driven by Amazon I think?)


So, there it is, my 10 must-buy applications for OS X.
