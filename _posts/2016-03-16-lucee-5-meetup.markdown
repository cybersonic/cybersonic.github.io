After a long period of silence, it looks like Lucee 5 is coming down the line nicely! The team have been working on getting [everything ready](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/lucee/7ly86ividGQ/xEdmmGIHBwAJ "Google Groups") for release "very soon"!

And although short notice, the [Lucee Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Lucee-Group/events/229634606/?rv=ea1 "Lucee 5 review - Lucee Group") are hosting an event next Tuesday (22 March 2016)  in which team members from the [Lucee Association](http://lucee.org/ "Lucee") will demo some nice new features! How exciting! 

If that wasn't enough, Michael Hnat, he famous for organising the awesome [CFCamp](http://cfcamp.org/ "Home - CFCamp 2016") conerence in Munich (if you haven't been totally make sure you go this year, we had a blast), will be popping by and you will get a chance to win a CFCamp ticket! 

The event is hosted at Pixl8's offices in London, with pizza and beer provided. [Sign up and come along!](http://www.meetup.com/Lucee-Group/events/229634606/?rv=ea1 "Lucee 5 review -  Lucee Group") .

If you can't make it, keep an eye out on the [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Lucee-Group/events/229634606/?rv=ea1 "Lucee 5 review - Lucee Group - Meetup") as it will be broadcast over youtube too.
