First off, a big thanks to the people that come to the UK CFUG last night. It was a nervous presentation for me since:<br />a) I am not an expert on the subject<br />b) Niklas (the host) wasnt going to be there as he is up in Edinbrugh<br />c) I had rushed the presentation off the previous night<br /><br />But it all turned out ok in the end.<br /><br />As has been requested I am making available the <a target="_blank" href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/markdrew/ukcfug_reactor_pres.pdf">presentation</a> and<a target="_blank" href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/markdrew/blogin15.zip"> the little blog application</a> I created to demonstrate <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" target="_blank">Model-Glue</a> and <a href="http://www.doughughes.net/" target="_blank">Reactor</a>. If you are downloading the blog&nbsp; application intending to use it, dont. It was just to demo a few aspects of the frameworks.<br /><br />After the weekend I shall sort out a podcast of (some) of the presentation, I really need to figure out how to record more than one hour (the max it seems for Garageband), or make my presentations smaller!<br /><br />In the zip, apart from the template site you can also find the FormUtil.cfc component that I created to quickly build a form from a Reactor record object, it isnt feature complete as I mentioned in the presentation, but it should give you some ideas on how to improve it (and if you want to improve it, send me the changes!!!)<br /><br />If you want to know how to use this, its fairly simple, you instantiate the FormUtils with the reactor object, and then you can get the string content for a form by calling the getFields method, passing in the table name and the Reactor record object:<br />
<div class="code">post = variables.reactor.createRecord('post');<br />formUtil = CreateObject('component', 'blogin15.controller.FormUtils').init(variables.reactor);<br />strForm = formUtil.getFields('post', post);</div>
<br />It was also really great to finally meet up with a couple of people who's blogs I have been following a lot in person, so a big hello to <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/andy/blog/index.cfm/2006/4/28/Model-Glue-and-Reator-at-UKCFUG--getAll" target="_blank">Andy Jarett</a> (have a great time in Mexico!) and <a href="http://instantbadger.blogspot.com/2006/04/you-look-lot-cooler-on-website.html" target="_blank">Alistair Davidson</a> (Instant Badger-cooler in shades, but very funny fella!). <br /><br />I might be doing another CFUG in the future about ColdSpring and Model Glue if people are interested. We are also looking for other topics to do presentations about, so any ideas are always welcome!
