<p>In a couple of weeks, the German ColdFusion User Group is holding <a href="http://www.coldfusioncamp.com/en/index.cfm">ColdFusion Camp 2008</a> in Munich. This is a great mini conference with some great sessions covering frameworks, tuning, PDF generation and Railo Extensions. All this for a mere €35 (£28, $45)! </p>
<p>I shall be covering the ModelGlue and Reactor camps for the framework battle against Coldbox (a fight to the death!). Andy Allan will also be presenting as well as Gert Franz, Louis Mojano, Darren Pywell and Peter Haak covering Security Awareness.</p>
<p>Apart from the main conference itself, there will be a day of training sessions (priced separately) covering Advanced ColdFusion, ColdBox, Subversion and Railo. Gert and I shall even be building a YouTube clone in a session! Not to be missed! </p>
<p>I think this will be the way ahead for a lot of conferences, as the organisers of "A Wee Dram" have mentioned, lower prices, shorter conferences, more locations. Get the power of ColdFusion out to the masses!</p>
