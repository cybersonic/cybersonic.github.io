Finally the sessions are up for all the conferences, which for me, gives me an idea of when I shall be presenting, and more importantly who I shall be following onto the stage, which having looked at this years conferences, is a very scary proposition! 

Firstly at <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/index.cfm?event=page.schedule">cfObjective</a> I am following Mark Mandel, another Mark, and I am sure everyone is going to confuse his Australian accent for my London accent and thing we are either both from the same country, or the same person (just notice the difference in space I take up compared to him, that will let you know who-is-who), but at least I shall be pulling Project:U out of the bag then!

What I feared the most come true, I am following Ben Forta onto the stage on the first day of <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/agenda.cfm">Scotch on the Rocks</a>. How can I follow that? Project:X is going to have to be really damned amazing to follow Ben "The Force" Forta! 

Then at <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/schedule">CFUnited</a> I seem to be presenting on the last day. The issue will be not so much following someone onto the stage but who else is presenting at the same time, and I have devastating opposition, Joe Rinehart doing a great <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/topics#topic-1300">AJAX presentation</a> and John Paul Ashenfelter talking about <a href="http://cfunited.com/go/topics#topic-1304">Build, Test, Deploy</a>, I doubt I will get anyone coming over to see what is happening with CFEclipse and Project:C !!!

Nonetheless, I am really looking forward to the summer!
