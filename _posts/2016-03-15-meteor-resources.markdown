At the end of my presentations on [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) I have a slide with a bunch of resources, but I have come to realise that they are 

1. Probably not enough
2. Can't be seen for long enough for them to be useful. 

Instead of just putting up the presentation, I thought I would share some of the links and my own resources:

1. Obviously your first port of call should be [meteor.com](http://meteor.com "Meteor") to download and get more info about the project including:
	1. [Documentation](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/) Which are pretty damn good and cover the whole of the Meteor API (switch to the full version to see even more) 
	2. [Tutorials](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) Including Blaze, [Angular](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/angular/creating-an-app) and [React](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) versions
	3. [Forums](https://forums.meteor.com/) where you can ask questions and become part of the Meteor community
2. The [Discover Meteor Book](http://book.discovermeteor.com/ "Discover Meteor") which is a great book on learning how to build applications that scale both in traffic and complexity.
3. If you are more visually minded and want to work along with someone, you can check out the [LevelUpTuts](https://www.youtube.com/user/LevelUpTuts/ "LevelUpTuts - YouTube") channel. They have some great play-lists including: 
	1.  [Intermediate Meteor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V "Intermediate Meteor - YouTube")
 	2. [User Accounts in Meteor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFMTabI7UK28e0e_CwoiYv6 "User Accounts in Meteor - YouTube")
 	3. And a couple of videos on [React and Meteor for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_HJCmoSvmc "Meteor &amp; React For Everyone - Series Introduction - YouTube")
4. Since most code in the world seems to be developed via Stack Overflow answers, you can also check you all the stuff marked ["meteor"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/meteor "Newest &#39;meteor&#39; Questions - Stack Overflow") there
5. If you want to keep up to date with all the news that is happening around Meteor and JavaScript a great site to check out is the [Crater.io](https://crater.io/ "Crater") which spawned the awesome [Creater Conf](http://conf.crater.io/ "Crater Remote Conference")
6. A big mention should go to Josh Owens, (who runs crater.io) as he blogs a great deal and has some great podcasts on the subject. Find him at [http://joshowens.me/](http://joshowens.me/ "Josh Owens")

I have also published some topics on this blog and also made a couple of videos such as:

Meteor for Server Side Developers

I hope that helps. Some of the links are obvious but if you can suggest more I shall update the post.
