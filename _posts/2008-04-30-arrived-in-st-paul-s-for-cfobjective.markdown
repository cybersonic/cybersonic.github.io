I finally made it to St Paul's for cfObjective 2008! 

After a brief detour through Amsterdam (and some strange interviews before boarding?!) I am finally here. Slightly lagged but ready to rock! 

I am in room 1313 of the conference hotel, and will be heading out soon to grab something to eat and maybe later check out a couple of places for drinks!

Let me know when anybody else arrives!
