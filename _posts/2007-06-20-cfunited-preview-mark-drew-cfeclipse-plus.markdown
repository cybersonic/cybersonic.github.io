With CFUnited looming (only a week to go!), the Online ColdFusion Meetup Group have asked me to do a quick (20 mins) preview presentation on my forthcoming CFEclipse session for CFUnited.

The description is as follows:

<blockquote>
In this 20-30 minute session, Mark Drew will preview his one-
hour class, CFEClipse Plus!, presenting how to use some
advanced features in CFEclipse, with an in-depth look at
modifying the libraries to add your own tags, using ant as part
of your development process and demonstrations of the new
features in CFEclipse. This presentation is geared towards
current users of CFEclipse.

</blockquote>

So come one, come all, especially if you cant make it to CFUnited!
