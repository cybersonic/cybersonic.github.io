<p><img src="/UserFiles/Image/spam.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="212" align="right" />As I posted previously about <a href="/blog/index.cfm/2006/4/29/Spam-Spam-Spam-and-Spam">spamming</a> through my subscribe pod here on my blog, sure enough, a few days later, I am starting to get nice emails from those Nigerian 419'ers. Of course I can send them my bank details so I can hold their supposed millions.<br /><br />Now, the email I am talking about I dont put out there, its just used to recieve comments to this blog and things related behind the scenes on this website. So its amazing that they got the exact email huh?<br /><br />I sure hope something comes along to stop them, in the meantime there is <a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/419Eater');" href="http://www.419eater.com/" target="_blank">419Eater</a></p>
