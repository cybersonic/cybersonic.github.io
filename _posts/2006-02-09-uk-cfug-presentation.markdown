It has just been confirmed that I shall be presenting CFEclipse at the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=4F39C57C-F1FF-921E-1E8846DB6D44FE3E">UK CFUG in London</a> on the 2nd of March.

Hope you all can make it (if you are in the country, if not get yourself a plane ticket ASAP!) 

I will be showing some of the new upcoming features in <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org>CFEclipse</a> as well as a sneak preview of the RDS plugin that Adobe will be releasing soon. If there is time, and I have finished the work on it, I shall also be showing the <a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/">Fusebox plugin</a> for CFEclipse.

If you have any specific areas you would like me to cover, leave me a message
