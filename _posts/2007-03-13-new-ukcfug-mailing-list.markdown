The UK ColdFusion User Group has setup a mailing list over at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ukcfug">Google Groups</a> so that UK based CF Developers can keep in touch and participate more in ideas about meetings and resources (such as training, jobs etc) 

We shall be doing some more announcements about upcoming meetings, but in the meantime you can do two things:

<ol>
<li>Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ukcfug">mailing list</a></li>
<li>Come and join us for a <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/9/CFDrinks-Reminder-Tue-13th-of-March">beer tonight</a>!</li>
</ol>
See you there!
