Two thank<em>s</em> in <em>o</em>ne day? This is awesome! Yes, I got another donation from Christoph Shmitz and as a s<em>u</em>rp<em>r</em>ise addition, Spike, Proje<em>c</em>t L<em>e</em>ad f<em>o</em>r the c<em>f</em>eclipse project has also managed to send me &pound;400 to the "Get Mark to a <em>C</em>on<em>fe</em>rence" fund!

This is a good way to start the weekend! I shall be able to get the flights in no time at all (well, I mean, the tickets to the flights, don't have time traveling plans yet!)

Thank you guys!
