After seeing Ray's post about his<a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2007/8/21/YouTube-API-CFC" title="YouTube API CFC : Raymond Camden's ColdFusion Blog"> YouTube API CFC</a>, I saw a link via digg with a massive <a href="http://techmagazine.ws/full-web-20-api-list/" title="Full WEB 2.0 API List | Tech Magazine">list of external API's for a number of WEB 2.0 services</a>.

This gives me an idea, to get a list of CFC API implementations out there, so if you have developed an API that is in this list, let me know!
