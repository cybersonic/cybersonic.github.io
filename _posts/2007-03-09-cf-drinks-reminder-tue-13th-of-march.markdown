Just a little reminder that next Tuesday we are meeting up at <a href="http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/pubfinder/details.php?OutletNumber=202">The Crosse Keys, 9 Gracechurch Street,City of London</a> for a few drinks. It will be great to meet up with some other CF'ers but it's not a CF specific meetup, so bring a friend.

Lots of people coming (check out <a href="http://inner-rhythm.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/9/cfdrinksreminder-locationLondon-date13th-March-2007">Kev's</a> blog)

I should also warn you, no amount of alcohol will get me to tell you what the new features in CFEclipse will be. I have signed an NDA by me, which will be embarrassing to break since I would have to sue myself, and that would be just plain weird

Hope to see you all <a href="http://local.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=EC3V+0DR&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=51.512575,-0.086088&amp;spn=0.009321,0.023217&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr">there</a>!
