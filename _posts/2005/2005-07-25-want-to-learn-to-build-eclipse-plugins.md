<a href="http://steve.secretagents.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=fuseblog.showcomments&amp;ArticleID=20050725113337">Want to learn to build Eclipse plugins?</a> Steve Nelson and I are going to do another chat about developing Eclipse plugins tomorrow. Hopefully there will be some interest in this as the CFEclipse team are trying to rally some more troops to increase the development effort in CFEclipse. So come along and contact Steve (contact info in link above) to be part of the chat.

I shall see if I can get a demo breeze room to help with the presentation.
