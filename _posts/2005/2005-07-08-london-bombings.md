I have to comment on the bombings in London yesterday. Just to put it in a personal perspective, Aldgate East, one of the stations that was hit is my stop for work. I went to work yesterday and everything was closed. I didnt see much and was late enough to miss any action.

This attack was not a "terror" attack in that we don't feel any terror from this here in London.  Most people just stoically 'got on with it' and made their best efforts to contact loved ones, work colleagues and family, then began their journeys home, or to the nearest pub to discuss the day's events. We are used to this and we have been in this situation before. That is why the events of yesterday are in no way comparable to America's feelings from September 11th.

Most people are back at work today.

Our hearts go out to the people that have died and are injured, but put it into perspective, about 2.6 million people travel into London by train. There must be double that figure that use the tube. There were in comparison very few victims. Of course there  were 37 (so far confirmed) more than there should be, but we are a strong and pragmatic breed.

Londoners still remember WW2 when we were bombed to smithereens, and many years of IRA bombings. I myself have been near 2 nail bombings in both Brixton (where I lived) and Soho (where I worked). I heard the Canary Wharf bomb. Everyone I speak to has a similar story to tell. We have all grown up with this. We always knew that we would be attacked - now however, we are just going to be more vigilant.

Being attacked by "Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qa'ida of Jihad Organisation in Europe" is surreal, and almost funny; its like being attacked by a Monty Python Liberation group.  Irrespective of politics and culture, this attack is just saddening.

Edit:
I just thought I would add a link to a review that I think nicely sums up the attitude of Londoners
