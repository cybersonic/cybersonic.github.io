Last night I spend a wonderful night at Somerset House watching Shaun of the Dead and then the English premier of Land of the Dead! I managed to bump into Simon Pegg, star of Shaun of the Dead and my favourite series, Spaced!

An awesome night in an astounding venue. You can feel the summer is ending as there are less and less things happening outside. Ho hum. Roll on next summer!
