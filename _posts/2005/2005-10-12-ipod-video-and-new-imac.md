Wow, holy cow. I mean awesome.. first it was on.. then not.. the rumours abounded, were discarded and now it is here. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" target="new">Video iPod</a>. Apple shoots, it scores with another great appliance. You get to watch the shows in a little screen, or plug it into a TV. Great stuff! you can download music videos of course, at a reasonable fee (about ????1.89) but they are also saying that you can get shows like Lost (which I am completely addicted to by the way).


Also a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> with iSight built in and a remote that you can now browse your music, videos, CDs and podcasts from your sofa... awesome! 

I have to replace my TV and I might go to straight to the 20" iMac. And my second generation iPod to the iPod movie... ahh.. now all donations accepted!
