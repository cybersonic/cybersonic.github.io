Well, the cat is out of the bag and I can finally tell friends and relatives what I was doing in Newton, Ma  a couple of weeks ago. I was visiting with the Coldfusion Team, including Tim Buntel and Ben Forta with Spike, Simeon Bateman and Rob Rohan to have a couple of good meetings with Macromedia to talk about how they will help us make CFEclipse a better product.

I am really psyched that they mentioned this over at CFUNITED finally as this really gets the ball rolling! Well, if anything its a real kick up the backside to get me coding and fixing those bugs (and back to ripping my hair out too.. but that is part of the course of course)

Sad I cant be at CFUNITED this year but I am sure Spike and Simeon will have a drink for me.
