Blogging has now even got easier when using <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">www.blogger.com</a>. They have released a plugin for word that allows you to publish posts you write straight from Word! <br/><br/>This also means that I am now going to have to spell check everything!<br/><br/>As an aside, I would say that most of my posts are done through the web interface. I don't have some blogging client side software, but I think it's a major step for most people since it is using a tool that they know.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, Word doesn't know the word blog or blogging.<br/><br/>
