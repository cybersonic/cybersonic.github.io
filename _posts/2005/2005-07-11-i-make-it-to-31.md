Yes, finally made it. Not even bombings on the underground could stop it. It is my birthday today! woohoo!
Had a great BBQ round my parents on sunday, even with those disposable jobbies I managed to cook up some nice steaks and marinated pork chops.

Still hyped about the CFEclipse announcement by Macromedia at CFUNITED thought. even a week later!

AND its sunny out here in London!
