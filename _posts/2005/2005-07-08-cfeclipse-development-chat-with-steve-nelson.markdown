Yesterday I had a long chat with <a href="http://steve.secretagents.com">Steve Nelson</a> over IM about a sample project that has content assistants that <a href="http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&#38;entry=EAC56B1B-D565-E33F-352CFAE205B36528">Spike</a> had posted for the developers out there.

Steve has posted <a href="http://steve.secretagents.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=fuseblog.showcomments&#38;ArticleID=20050707020008" id="20050707020008"> the chat</a> (in full! including dumb comments) so that hopefully it will answer some of the questions potential CFEclipse developers might have and how they can figure their way round developing a plugin
