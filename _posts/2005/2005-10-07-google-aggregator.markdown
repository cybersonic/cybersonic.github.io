I subscribe to a number of Coldfusion based RSS feeds such as <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/rss.cfm?mode=full">Ben Forta's</a>, <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/rss.cfm?mode=full">Sean Corfield's</a>, <a href="http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/rss.cfm?mode=full">Spike</a> and <a href="http://www.robrohan.com/blog/rss.cfm?mode=full">Rob Rohan's </a> amongst many. The great thing is that I mainly read these on the Mac using Safari as I have them all bookmarked and can open them all up at the same time. This is fantastic on the mac but what can I do on the PC?

Well Google have launched a news aggregator application. I am just testing it out and importing all my feeds to see what I think of it. Watch this space!
