This took me by surprise this morning, I hit the Apple website (as you do) and on the cover there was something that blew me away. The iPod nano. A small version of the iPod with screen and all the features you would expect, but smaller than anything you would expect!

Check it out!

Available in 2Gb and 4Gb versions. With colour screen and all!

Darn sexy bit of kit that!
