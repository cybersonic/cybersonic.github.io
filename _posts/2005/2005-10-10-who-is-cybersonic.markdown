I have had a nickname of cybersonic for yonks. I mean a real long time, 12 years or so.  A friend gave it to me as I had long dreadlocks tied up behind my head (looking like a certain fast game character) and a penchant for spending many hours behind the computer shooting germanz playing Wolfenstein 3D

so whats the point of this post? Well.. I want to know why now when I look for my nickname I get a damn Toothbrush!!!
