I finally made it to <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" title="Scotch on the Rocks 2008 - The European ColdFusion Conference">Scotch on the Rocks</a> in Edinburgh. Next time, I take the train.

The problem is this, in the UK we dont have identity cards and have no need to carry any form of identification... except when flying. So guess who forgot his passport at home this morning?

Well, I made it home and then to the airport, just in time to miss the flight. The problem being that the transport from one terminal (south) to the other (north) in Gatwick decided to stop working... so the precious last few minutes that I had were lost.

BA were kind enough to move me to a later flight, but heart attacks and sweat from running from one side of London to another then back down to Gatwick not wistanding, I managed to make it to Edinburgh. 

So, just so you know I am at the George hotel, room 210 if you want to catch up.

Let the Scotch begin!
