Next Monday (14th of May 2016) I shall be presenting at the Cambridge Javascript and Node meetup! If you are into Meteor, or just curious or are simply in the area why not sign up and drop by?

It will be a fun packed presentation showing you what you can do with the awesome realtime framework that is Meteor! 

Go on, what's stopping you? Do it!
