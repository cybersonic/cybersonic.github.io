After a number of days it looks like the <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/">model-glue</a> site is back up! Hurrah!
Now you can all download your MG core files and get on with those projects.

It looks like they have also moved their hosting to HostMySite.com. I am thinking of looking for a new host for this blog, but I might do it over here in blighty rather than in some USA datacenter.
