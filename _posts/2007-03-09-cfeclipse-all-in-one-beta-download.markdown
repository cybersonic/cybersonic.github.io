I have been doing some tests with building a Standalone (or All-in-One) distribution of CFEclipse for a while.

I have finally managed to get it working, and I am asking for opinions from people to see if they can get it running ok etc.

The versions I have put up are:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">Windows</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">OS X (Intel)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">OS X (PPC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">Linux GTK (Intel)</a></li>
</ul>

Download, unzip and run. Then let me know what you think! Hopefully an all-in-one version will be a better "path" for people to get into using CFEclipse. 

I need to add a welcome page and some more help, you know, all those *nice* things which I never have the time to write, so if anybody wants to do that (the welcome page content, not the programming itself) let me know too!
