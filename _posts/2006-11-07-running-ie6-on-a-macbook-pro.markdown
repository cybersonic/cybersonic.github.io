Tired of having to dual boot with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">BootCamp</a>? Just need to do something on one of those incompatible sites, but cant wait for <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">Parallels</a> to start up a WHOLE windows session? Well, why not try <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac/">CrossOver</a>?I have installed it for the sole purpose of running IE6 on my Mac but you can also install a number of supported applications including Microsoft Project, Microsoft Office and Visio.

Very interesting indeed, although you do need your original OS X install disks (which I cant find at the moment) to install the quartz-vm that comes with X11 to make it look all nice.

UPDATE: if you cant find your quartz-vm or indeed your initial install disks, you can download the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/x11update2006.html">X11 updater</a>, open the disk image and then start CrossOver and point it to the X11Update2006.pkg file (no need to install the package, CrossOver will find and install what it needs)
