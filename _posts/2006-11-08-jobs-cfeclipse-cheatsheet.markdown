Another job that has come up if anyone wants to take it has very little CF and is mainly a design/html job. Shouldn't take too long. Basically its to create an A4 cheat sheet of shortcuts, snippet codes etc that people can print out and use.

I have made a start on it, but if someone can take the reins and complete the job and make it look superb, I would be very grateful, as I would assume the rest of the community would be too!

You can download the my cheat sheet here, and the plan is to have it as a page that you can visit, or view as a PDF for printing (cfcontent to the rescue?).

Here are some samples of other cheat sheets:
