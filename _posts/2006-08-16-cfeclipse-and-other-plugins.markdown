A comment on my blog the other day from someone that is moving to Eclipse from Dreamweaver reminded me that (unlike me) there are other people in the community that have to do things like editing CSS and JS files as part of their job (oh those heady days, I am just doing CFC's and Java now for my sins) so I thought I would put some pointers for people out there with the options.

Dale asked what plugins are available for the following:
<ol>
<li>SVN</li>
<li>DB Browser / Query designer</li>
<li>CSS Editor</li>
<li>Regex builder</li>
<li>Xpath search builder.</li>
</ol>

So, taking one at a time:

<strong>SVN</strong>

THE plugin that I can highly recommend is called >a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> and its hosted over at tigris.org. Easy to install (just put the update site) and works a treat

<strong>DB Browser /Query designer</strong>

The main plugin I recommend for for a ColdFusion Developer is the ColdFusion Extensions for FlexBuilder. They come with the FlexBuilder 2 download, once you have uncompressed the installer, look in the installation directory and you can find them there. They are very handy even if you dont use FlexBuilder. 

The other plugin I can highly recommend that covers database browsing and a hell of a lot more is <a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/">MyEclipse</a>. Its a pretty cheap plugin considering all that it does and apart from a Database Browser it provides lots of tooling for webservices, JSP and J2EE as well as HTML editors etc. Its a quality plugin that is for sure.

<strong>CSS Editor</strong>

There are a few out there, I can recommend <a href="http://robrohan.com/projects/afae/">AFAE</a> (by Rob Rohan, the guy who started CFEclipse!), <a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/">MyEclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">Eclipse Web Tools Platform</a> and to a smaller extent <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> (there are some things that annoy me about that plugin)

<strong>Regex builder</strong>

The one and only <a href="http://brosinski.com/regex/">Bronski Regular Expression Tester</a> plugin for Eclipse is awesome.

<strong>Xpath search builder.</strong>

I never needed one of this that much (I bumbled my way through it) but a quick <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=xpath+eclipse+plugin">google search</a> later and I found <a href="http://www.purpletech.com/xpe/index.jsp">this one</a> which looks like is just the ticket


I hope you find these useful!
