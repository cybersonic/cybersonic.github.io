I am currently wanting to replace a DHTML tree for an application with a cftree (for various cross browser and OS reasons). It all works lovely so far, but the problem is that I don't know how to pre-expand a treeitem (on the server side) and post-expand a tree item, say through a javascript call.

So, I turn the question to the wise (and very handsome I am sure) audience of my blog.

Any ideas?
