<p><a href="http://www.edgewebhosting.net"><img src="http://www.edgewebhosting.net/images/logolast.gif" border="0" alt="" width="200" height="82" align="left" /></a>I am not sure if people know this (and yes, I shall get round to putting up a banner) but the guys at <a href="http://www.edgewebhosting.net">EdgeWebHosting</a> have been hosting my site on a dedicated server that allows me to both maintain this blog as well as a bunch of small projects that I have for quite a while now. I have always got on with Vlad at all the conferences and the choice seemed good. </p>
<p>So far the service has been stellar, no downtime etc. But normally, that is what you expect right? A true test really comes when things go wrong. </p>
<p>And on Tuesday apparently they did. </p>
<p>I woke up to find that I had a missing call from the USA. A bit confusing, but when I heard the voicemail, it was Dave, one of the support engineers at Edge Web Hosting that had spotted suspicious activity on my site. I wont go into all the details here of the exploit (lets say that it looked a lot worse than it ended up being and nothing was actually compromised) , but throughout Tuesday, they were the most on the ball company I have ever hosted with in keeping me up to date. </p>
<p>(before you ask, it was a mis configuration I did to apache, for a quick job that I should have removed and was exploited. Let's leave it at that)</p>
<p>I can't recommend them enough, and even through emails updating me on the findings of the supposed intrusion including IM'ing for information etc. </p>
<p>When was the last time YOU had service like that eh?</p>
<p>So all in all big thanks to the guys at <a href="http://www.edgewebhosting.net">Edge Web Hosting</a>! </p>
