This week has been a crazy busy week for CFEclipse Updates. Today I released <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/update/">CFEclipse 1.3.1.3</a>, which includes a number of fixes including the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/248">missing shortcuts</a> and other issues [<a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/107">107</a>, <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/145">145</a>, <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/186">186</a>]. 

I have also had a lot of from a partner in crime: <a href="http://www.newmediadevelopment.net/">Paul Vernon from New Media Development</a>. He he has done a  LOT of work on the niggly bugs so that I can get on with some new features, so a huge amount of kudos goes to him!

Other things  on the stove in the CFEclipse world: 
<ul>
	<li>Archived Update Sites: downloads for each of the releases are now available from <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/update/">http://www.cfeclipse.org/update/</a>, the same location as the update site. I shall be updating the documentation in the CFEclipse site at some point today to make the changes more well known.</li>
	<li>Code Tidying: We are doing some investigations into ways of implementing code tidying a bit like CodeSweeper, but this will probably be as a standalone plugin, rather than a fixed part of CFEclipse (it will come with CFEclipse but also available standalone) </li>
	<li>Templates: another feature that people have been asking for, and I am looking into implementing this at some point are auto-complete Templates, this feature can be seen in the Ant and Java editors (<a href="http://media27a.libsyn.com/podcasts/b2c9d23d846a86959e58c3126605c8e0/45f12d4c/markdrew/EclipseTemplates.mov">video here</a>, better explains it) but again, that is something I need to look into implementing</li>
</ul>

On a slightly different note, I seem to have been voted <a href="http://trond.ulseth.no/index.cfm/2007/3/8/Man-of-the-Month-Mark-Drew">Man of the Month</a> by Trond! Thanks Trond! Glasses of JD drunk in celebration!
