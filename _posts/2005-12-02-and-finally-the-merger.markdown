I knew it in my bones, at some point in December Macromedia and Adobe were going to merge. I just didnt know when, so finally the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200512/120105MACRAcquisitionClose.html">Press Release</a> has been posted over at adobe.com. Looks like its this saturday.

I am trying to think upbeat thoughts on this, but still a bit tense with the future of Coldfusion and CFEclipse.
