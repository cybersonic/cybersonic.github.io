Jared has finally announced some of the speakers for the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/index.cfm?event=page.sessions">cfObjective</a> conference, and amongst many of the luminaries such as Sean, Ray and Joe you will find me presenting on CFEclipse! 

This is going to be one hot conference so book your tickets early I say! If you don't you are going to miss the announcement of a new project I have been working on. 

This *top secret* project is so amazing, I am asking Jared to fit seat-belts to each of the seats as I am sure when I show this off, people *WILL* fall off their chairs. 

I am REALLY excited about this project, the few people I have shown it to have been very impressed and I know when I show it live and working, jaws will drop.

So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/index.cfm?event=page.register">Go register now</a>!

Also, if you cant make it to cfObjective, there is also <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks </a>a month later, where we shall also be unveiling another feature that is going to make you so excited your socks will have to be stapled to your feet. 

This will be the year of massive announcements from me by the way :)

Oh... and I am working on *ANOTHER* top secret project, which I hope to announce in the next few weeks.

In the meantime, I am trying to fit something called *life* and *sleep* in somewhere but I can do those in the winter.

P.s. Don't even ask me what I am announcing at <a href="http://cfunited.com/2007/">CFUnited</a>, I know that will also make people do a little wiggle too!
