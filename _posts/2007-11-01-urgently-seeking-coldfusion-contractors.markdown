As some people might have noticed, its got so busy round here that I haven't been blogging as much as I used to and basically been keeping my head down and eyes on coding for the last few months.

To aliviate this situation, <a href="http://www.designuk.com/" title="Design UK - Web design agency London">Design UK</a>, the company I work for is desperately seeking a couple of ColdFusion contractors to work in our London offices for a minimum of 2 weeks (could be up till XMas).
<more />
No, you can't do the work remotely, sorry, don't ask. No, really... just don't.  


Also, if you are an agency, <b>don't call me or email me</b>. Just don't, really, you WILL get abuse, and I am sure you don't want that.

The pay is dependent on experience (hey, I want to pay nothing, you want a lot, we compromise). The kind of experience that we are seeking is:

<ul>
	<li> 2 years minimum ColdFusion (obviously) </li>
	<li> Experience of Frameworks especially Model-Glue and ColdSpring are a massive plus</li>
	<li> SQL Server knowledge</li>
	<li> HTML, JavaScript and CSS (yep, there is front end work to do too!)</li>
	<li> XML (generating and parsing)</li>
	<li> Subversion and Trac knowledge is also a plus </li>
	
</ul>

Start date is as soon as possible, so if you are available and want some work, let me know by emailing me your CV to <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:pnerref\100qrfvtahx\056pbz?fhowrpg=[Znex Qerj'f Oybt] PS Pbagenpgbe Ebyrf\">pnerref\100qrfvtahx\056pbz<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c)\{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script>.
