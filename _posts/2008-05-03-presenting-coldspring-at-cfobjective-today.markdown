Sean <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/cfObjective_2008_Introduction_to_ColdSpring" title="An Architect's View - cf.Objective() 2008 Introduction to ColdSpring">mentioned last night</a>,  due to Hal Helms being unable to come to cfObjective because of health reasons a few sessions have been flipped about but like one of those slidey puzzles where you are trying to get those squares in order to make a picture of a butterfly, there is still a slot missing. 

I shall try to fill in that slot with a introductory presentation into ColdSpring called "ColdSpring: Better living through configuration". Since its a last minute change, I am hoping *some* people will turn up! 

I actually enjoy doing this presentation so it should be a laugh if anything!
