Charlie Arehart has posted a <a href="http://carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/7/10/come_read_70_CFEclipse_bloggers">couple</a> of great <a href="http://carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/7/10/come_read_70_CFEclipse_bloggers_part2">lists</a> of CFEclipse bloggers out there. I am amazed at the number of people blogging about it to be honest.

So now, if you are getting started you can read about other people's experiences, tips and thoughts.

As a side note, I should say that <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" title="CFEclipse: The ColdFusion IDE for Eclipse">CFEclipse</a> has got a <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse" title="CFEclipse Plugin - Trac">wiki</a>, and there is even a link from the front page now, so if you have other questions they are likely to be answered there. A big thanks has to go to <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/andy/blog/index.cfm" title="Andy Jarrett">Andy Jarrett</a> and <a href="http://www.thecrumb.com/" title="thecrumb.com">Jim Priest</a> for keeping it up to date! They are officially the Wiki Documentation Team of the CFEclipse Project, so I would like to welcome them to the CFEclipse Crew!
