So, Shimmy managed to spot something in the EDI page of <a href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/">http://www.thehansofoundation.org/</a> if you go to coordinates y:629 and x: 291 and click, you get a compass, click on that and you are taken to another <a href="http://www.letyourcompassguideyou.com/">site</a><br /><br />Twiddle the compass to 108 degrees (I wonder where that number come from?) and you will get a flashing <a href="/UserFiles/Image/lostClue4.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a>. There is a password here, but I dont know where to use it. Anyone figure it out let me know!
