A bit late on the posting but I wanted to give a big thanks to Charlie Griefer and Florence Bowden for their very kind and generous donations!

Not sure if people noticed but I changed the subject of the donation box, why? Well, I shall be speaking at <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/2007/">CFunited</a>, <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks</a> and <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/">cf.Objective()</a> this year (all going well!) so I am hoping to get some donations towards the travel to these conferences. 

I love talking about CFEclipse to people, especially getting the level feedback from users that these conferences offer and have take time off my day job to do this. Since it isn't the core of my day job of course, travel to these conferences comes out of my own pocket (and holiday time!). 

I really want to thank you both for this!  I think we should put a sponsors page on the project website to really do justice to these fantastic gestures.
