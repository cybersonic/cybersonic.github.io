<p>Today I shared some important news about the Railo company and how we are setting up the future. </p>
<p>You can read the post over in the Railo blog: <a href="http://blog.getrailo.com/post.cfm/railo-at-cf-objective-the-evolution-of-railo">http://blog.getrailo.com/post.cfm/railo-at-cf-objective-the-evolution-of-railo</a></p>
<p>In essence we have set it up so we can say to all CFML developers:</p>
<blockquote>
CFML is HERE TO STAY
<br />We are MARKETING it<br />We are SUPPORTING it<br />We are DEVELOPING it<br />For the next 10 years and foreseeable future</blockquote>
<p>
Viva la Railo-vucion!</p>
