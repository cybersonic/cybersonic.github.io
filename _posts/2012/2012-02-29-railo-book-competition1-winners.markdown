<p>A couple of weeks ago I run a competition to win my <a href="http://bit.ly/RailoBook" target="_blank">Railo 3 Beginner's Guide book</a>. So now is the time to announce the winners! </p>
<p>In first place is Ben B. who wins a signed copy of the book for his myth "The cost for creating a cfc object is minimal and has no real cost."</p>
<p>In joint second place, winning an electronic copy of the book are:<br />Ray V. with his myth "Is there really a cookie called CFMagic?"<br />and<br />Steven R. with his myth "ColdFusion will always timeout to the value I provide in the ColdFusion Adminsitrator."</p>
<p>In third place, winning a mention in my presentation is Brendan with his myth "cfml produced html is full of whitespace"</p>
<p>Congratulations to you all! I shall get the presentation updated for <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective</a>! </p>
<p>I have also put the code up on how I run the code and presentation on github, so you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/cybersonic/CFML-Mythbusters" target="_blank">CFML Mythbusters</a> presentation for yourself!</p>
