Just before the break for the holidays I was informed by the awesome guys and gals at Packt Publishing that my book "Railo 3: Beginner's Guide" was finally out! 
</p>
<p>It wasn't enough that they told me it was out, they even sent me a few paper versions of the book, which I shall of course treasure as my first work in print! </p>
<p>Anyway, the book that is over 300 pages long (actually 364), has 10 chock-a-block chapters filled with Railo Server Goodness:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1: Introducing Railo Server</li>
<li>Chapter 2: Installing Railo Server</li>
<li>Chapter 3: CFML Language</li>
<li>Chapter 4: Railo Server Administration</li>
<li>Chapter 5: Developing Applications with Railo Server</li>
<li>Chapter 6: Advanced CFML Functionality</li>
<li>Chapter 7: Multimedia and AJAX</li>
<li>Chapter 8: Resources and Mappings</li>
<li>Chapter 9: Extending Railo Server</li>
<li>Chapter 10: Creating a Video-sharing Application</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Of course, if just reading that list is not enough, why not check out the <a href="http://bit.ly/RailoBookTOC">FULL listing</a> or even download a <a href="http://bit.ly/RailoBookChapter">Sample Chapter?</a></p>
<p>But instead of just skimming over the top, why not get a full copy if the book? You can get it <a href="http://bit.ly/RailoBook">HERE</a> from the Packt Publishing website! It comes in many flavours, including Paper,PDF,  ePub and Mobi downloads and also on <a href="http://packtlib.packtpub.com/">PacktLib</a></p>
<p>If you do get a copy, let me know what you think! I am currently thinking of the next book too!</p>
