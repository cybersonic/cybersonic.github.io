I have been working over the last week quite hard to finalise some of the features that I shall be demonstrating at the UK CFUG on March 2nd.&nbsp; One of the new features in CFEclipse that I have just finished is a new view (actually a replacement of the Package View) called the Component Explorer. <br /><br />The Component Explorer as you might guess is a new view that allows you to see all the components in a project. The view allows you to select projects and it then gives you a tree of all the packages, components, functions and arguments that are available in a project. <br /><br />Another issue that I tried to address was the fact that by default the component explorer uses the name of the project you have created in CFEclipse, of course this is not optimal as a user might have a different mapping to the components or the project name doesnt match the root folder.&nbsp; To overcome this, there is a new project preference that you can define the Component root. Hopefully doing this will solve a number of issues that people might have with mappings of components.<br /><br />By default double clicking on a component will open that component. Double clicking on a function will insert cfinvoke code into the current document.<br /><br />There are other functions I have added, that hopefully will be helpful for people out there, if you right click on a Component you can insert a CreateObject function into your document. There is also a get Details function which displays a pop-up with summary information about that component. I have also added something that I hope works on most people's setup, which is the ability to Get Description of a component using the Coldfusion server that you have setup for that project. It will try and get the host and then take you to the cfcexplorer thats built into Coldfusion.<br /><br />The functions of a component also have some right-click actions that are helpful, you can insert CreateObject code into the current document as well as cfinvoke code if you wish. It also has a nice Get Details function also that shows you information about that function (what roles have access to it, the access method, the return type, whether it outputs etc.)<br /><br />Since I just finished this feature for CFEclipse it would need some testing, so get in touch if you have any issues/problems/comments. <br /><br />Most of the issues can be resolved with changing the project properties panel I hope!<br /><br />Check out some screenshots until you can get a nightly build.<br /><a target="_blank" href="/UserFiles/Image/picture1.png"><img width="70" height="100" border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/Picture1.png" alt="" /></a><a target="_blank" href="/UserFiles/Image/picture2.png"><img width="72" height="50" border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/picture2.png" alt="" /></a><a href="/UserFiles/Image/picture3.png" target="_blank"><img width="72" height="56" border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/picture3.png" alt="" /></a><a href="/UserFiles/Image/picture4.png" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/picture4.png" alt="" /></a><a href="/UserFiles/Image/picture5.png" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/picture5.png" alt="" /></a><a href="/UserFiles/Image/picture6.png" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse/thmbs/picture6.png" alt="" /></a>
