Aptana, the people behind the <a href="http://www.aptana.com/studio" title="Aptana Studio | Aptana">Aptana IDE</a> and <a href="http://www.aptana.com/jaxer" title="Aptana Jaxer | Aptana">Jaxer</a>, have announced <a href="http://www.aptana.com/cloud" title="Aptana Cloud | Aptana">Aptana Cloud</a> which describes itself as:

<blockquote>
	... a scalable Elastic Application Cloudâ„¢ featuring the most popular and widely adopted Web infrastructure, ready to use and ready to scale as you need it. Aptana Cloud also plugs right into your IDE to provide instant deployment, smart synchronization, and seamless migration as you scale. Aptana Cloud is ideal for developers who use scripting languages to create Ajax, Facebook, mySpace and all other sorts of Web applications.
</blockquote>

Its nice to see a variety of players in this market apart from the usual gorillas of <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" title="Google App Engine - Google Code">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011" title="Amazon.com: Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Grid Computing: Amazon Web Services">Amazon</a>. It would be interesting to see CFML applications deployed easily in this manner in my opinion.

I also wonder if companies like Microsoft and Yahoo would get involved in this? They already have the infrastructure, of course, not sure how Windows servers would handle this! 

Aptana Cloud is currently in beta and there is a <a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e2abgqrhffkgzt7x/start" title="Survey : Questions">early access request form</a> if you would like to get involved!
