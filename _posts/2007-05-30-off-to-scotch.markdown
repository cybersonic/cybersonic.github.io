Its nearly the end of the day here at <a href="http://www.designuk.com/">Design UK Headquarters</a> in Central London, and on this VERY exciting day I am heading off to Edinburgh to enjoy two days of awesome lectures at Scotch on the Rocks. 

I am really looking forward to this conference, as apart from myself doing TWO (yep, you heard right) different presentations, it is also the day that <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion8/">Coldfusion 8</a> finally went public!

Mine's a large one!
