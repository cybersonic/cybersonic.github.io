AS a recent convert to GMail and a Mac user this is exciting stuff! The site says:

<em>Beta testers for Google's upcoming Gmail service, which will offer 1GB of storage and leverage the company's search technology to organize e-mail, have been informed that Safari 1.2.1 is now on the list of compatible browsers. Gmail also currently supports Netscape 7.1 or higher, Mozilla 1.4 or higher and Mozilla Firefox 0.8 or higher on the Macintosh. Google can't say when the service will end Beta testing and become widely available, but the company does note that it hopes to add to Gmail's list of supported browsers "in the near future."</em>
