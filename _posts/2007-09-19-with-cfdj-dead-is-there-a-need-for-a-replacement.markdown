After my little time away from reading blogs etc, I noticed that CFDJ died a little death. I was quite sad to see it go (I still have a stack of old issues to go through, apparently CF7 is going to be released quite soon!) as I found it pretty nice to read on the commute and gave me some good ideas for work. What can we do to replace it, if anyting?With a specialist magazine gone for CF developers, there is of course the <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/" title="ColdFusion Articles, News and Reviews">Fusion Authority Quarterly Update</a> that keeps us updated (a very high quality publication I must say!) and the <a href="http://www.coldfusionweekly.com/" title="Home | ColdFusion Weekly">ColdFusion Weekly Podcast</a> to keep my ears in check,  but I was wondering what the community at large, both the readers and authors, would make of an online based journal with the idea that you can print out "issues" and set publication dates? Is there a requirement for this? Would you read it?

I have been thinking of doing something like this for a bit of fun and wondered on the community's opinion, and if there are authors out there, would you be willing to contribute? (hey, maybe make it a co-op so that any advertising money goes back to the authors)?

All your views are welcome by the way.
