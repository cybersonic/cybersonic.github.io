Finally Skype has video capabilities for OS X users! I mean, its back on par with iChat, but now (in theory, havent tried it) you can both voice and video chat from a PC -> Mac  and vice-versa!

I wasnt able to find the download over at skype.com, you can actually get it over from <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24474">versiontracker.com</a>

My username on Skype is cybersonicuk,  but I never chat to strangers :)
