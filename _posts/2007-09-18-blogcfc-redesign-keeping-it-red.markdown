Welcome to my blog, my re-designed blog! So, finally I get rid of that *mustard* colour, and back to my usual angry red, but fear not, I have added some rounded corners so you dont feel so angry when reading the post (clever eh? a red padded room)

One of the things that I am thinking about is the fact that there are several things one has to do when simply changing the stylesheet of a blog:<ol>
	<li>Change some of the markup to match that of the new stylesheet (ok, it should be the other way round, but sometimes you need some magic for that two column thing)</li>
	<li>Re-set your pods, which blogcfc has a handy manager for, if you create the /includes/pods/pods.xml file so it works</li>
	<li>Add the textblogs for google tracking and adverts</li>
</ol>

Now, all of this does not seem too bad, but it actually means changing a bunch of files, that when the next version of BlogCFC comes along, you will lose. Anybody got any ideas how I can get round this?

A while back (and lost in a harddrive somewhere) I did an addition to to blogcfc so that I could change stylesheets as a setting, would this be something people are interested in? As well as maybe a document to say what all the styles that are needed for blogCFC?
