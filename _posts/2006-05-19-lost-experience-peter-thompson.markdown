Maybe another password in the making? Well, we have been through three of the four members of the board of directors of the hanso foundation:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Alvar Hanso, that hasnt been seen for even a long while before the grany photo was taken</li>
    <li>Dr Rhomas Mittelwork, that doesnt seem to be as qualified as he should <br /></li>
    <li>Hugh McIntyre, that is not the dedicated family man it seems.</li>
</ul>
That leaves us with Peter Thompson. If go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/#section=bios">Bios section</a> and check him out you will see some letters spelling out (swipe to see): <font color="white">SURVIVOR GUILT</font><br /><br />He was turned to the foundation because he had lung and pancreatic cancer, and had a miraculous cure. I wonder what the clue here is?
