I kind of missed this, but yesterday was the 5th Birthday of the Eclipse project. Being such a great platform to develop plugins and IDE's, the CFEclipse team wish to thank all the people working on the platform and hope that it keeps on going from strength to strength!

Can you spot us on the <a href="http://birthday.eclipse.org:80/images/map.php?builder">Product Hall of Fame</a>?
