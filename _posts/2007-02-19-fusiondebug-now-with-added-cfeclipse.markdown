I am finally back from my little trip to Morocco, had a blast and rode a camel named Michael Jackson (More to come on that soon I am sure!)

Whilst I was away, <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/">Fusion Debug 2.0</a> was finally released! This is a great plugin for Eclipse that allows you to add breakpoints to your code in CFEclipse and debug your application directly.

Apart from a number of new features and improvements, FusionDebug now includes <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse 1.3</a> as part of its installer!

Definitely worth checking out now! All your tools in one install.
