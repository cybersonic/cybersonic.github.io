<a href="http://robrohan.com/2007/02/07/blogging-from-within-eclipse-metaweblog-plugin/">Rob Rohan</a> has done an amazing plugin for Eclipse, which allows you to make blog posts straight from your favourite IDE

Its definately worth checking out. You could can use the <a href="http://robrohan.com/projects/afae/">AFAE editor</a> as your main editor or you can use <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> (you just need to map *.blog files to CFEclipse)

Definately a real boon, forget alt + Tab!


Edit: I just posted this from it, so you know.
Edit2: There are some problems getting blog posts from BlogCFC at the moment, but you can create blog posts without problems. Rob is working on it ;)
