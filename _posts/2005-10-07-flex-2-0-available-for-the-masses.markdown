Flex so far has been a bit out of reach for a lot of projects with its $10K price point. I know, I know, it speeds up the development so if you have a large project you would expect that kind of price point for an app server license, but so far that has been putting the punters away. At least the people who make the financial decisions.

Macromedia announced yesterday (and I picked it up from <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=e&entry=1761">Ben Forta's</a> blog that the new version of Flex licensing will be on a tiered model that: 

<blockquote>...will be sold for less than $1000 per developer and will include the ability to develop, compile, and deploy Flex applications that connect to XML and SOAP web services with no additional charges or server licensing required
</blockquote>

This means that they have basically put a compiler into the new Flex Builder (know as Zorn) that I presume will create a WAR file ready for you to deploy to your application server. 

Flex Builder is built on Eclipse the same as the project I work on <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>.

I wonder if we can build the same thing into CFEclipse. And I wonder if it would be useful that after all the development of an application you can simply bundle it up pre-compiled and push it to the server as a WAR or EAR file ready for deployment?

This of course is already available in the CFServer but taking that to CFEclipse might be a bit difficult. Watch this space on more thoughts on that.
