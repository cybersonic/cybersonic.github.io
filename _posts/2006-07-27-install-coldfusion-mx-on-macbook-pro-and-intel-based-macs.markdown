Mark Andrachek has <a href="http://webmages.com/cfmxIntelOSXguide.html">posted a great walkthrough</a> on how to finally install ColdFusion on your brand new spanking MacBooks and Intel based Macs

The main part that had stumped me was building the Apache Connector to Jrun but he pointed out that you had to download the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/jrun/download/sdk/">JRun OEM SDK</a> to get the connector to compile.

He has a full guide that I shall try out later on today! 

A pointer for people out there, Verity DOES NOT WORK since it is not supported on OS X
