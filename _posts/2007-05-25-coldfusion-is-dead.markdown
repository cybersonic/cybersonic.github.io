... apparently, at least according to <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9020942&pageNumber=2" target="_blank">this article</a>

Did I miss something? I have just hired 2 CF developers, we have more work that we can take on, and I get daily approaches from head hunters offering me jobs in the field, is that a dead technology if the market is on the way up?


I also happen to have other technologies on my CV (.net, php etc) and I haven't got any requests for those, well, perhaps a couple but not at the same level as CF work!

Go leave a comment, but remember to count to 10 before adding it.
