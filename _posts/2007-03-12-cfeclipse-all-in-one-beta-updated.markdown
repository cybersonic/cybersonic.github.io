This weekend I spent some time updating the install and checking that it worked for the CFEclipse 1.3.1.3 All-in-One Beta installer.

The CFEclipse A-i-O (tired of typing) is a single download package of Eclipse, CFEclipse, ANT, SVN and CVS so you dont need to do any updates, you can just download, unzip and go (or stay and code, whichever you prefer)

My previous post's links got invalidated so I have put a temporary page up for you to download them, also letting you know when I uploaded the file.

You can check it out here: <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/</a>

I am still working on the linux one and will be trying to get a nice *WORKING* upload up whenever Ubuntu decides to work...
