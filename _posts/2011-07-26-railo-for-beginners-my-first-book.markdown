<p>I got got confirmation from <a title="Packt Publishing Technical &amp; IT Book and eBook Store" href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> that the RAW (read as it's written) version of the Railo for Beginners book has been released! </p>
<p>I have been writing this book for a while with the help of Gert Franz (Railo Technologies), Andrea Campolonghi and Paul Klinkenberg (Railo Volunteers). And of course a bunch of people that have been reviewing the book for me.</p>
<p>
It's my first book so it has been a pretty long labour, especially since I publicly admit I coudl barely write an essay! But the prodding and cajoling by the editors to get me to finish each chapter has definately helped! 
</p>
<p>
The book covers a lot of the aspects of Railo Server and I am hoping that by having this book out there more people will be interested in CFML and of course, Railo Server!
</p>
<p>
To quote the back cover:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Railo Server is one of the quickest ways to start developing complex web applications online. Widely considered as the fastest CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) engine, Railo allows you to create dynamic web pages that can change depending on user input, database lookups, or even the time of day.
</p>

You will learn how to install Railo and the basics of CFML to allow you to gradually build up your knowledge, and your dynamic web applications, as the book progresses.</p>
