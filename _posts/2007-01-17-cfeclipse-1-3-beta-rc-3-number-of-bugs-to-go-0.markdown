I am delighted to say that looking at the current roadmap for <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/roadmap">CFEclipse 1.3</a> the current version's active bugs have finally reached ZERO!

Now, this doesn't mean there are no bugs. A number of tickets have been moved either to the final 1.3 or will be fixed in 1.4 as there will be some work going on the areas that those tickets belonged to.

Anyway, I just wanted to say a little huzza! Getting closer and closer!
