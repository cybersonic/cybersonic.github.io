About the most anticipated thing this year (apart from my move back to london). The iTunes Music Store from Apple is finally hitting europe which means that you will be able to buy each tune and play it on your ipod, legally!!!
FANTASTIC
you can get itunes for both pc and mac... so dont moan you dont have a mac
