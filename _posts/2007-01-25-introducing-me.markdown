Ahh, <a href="http://www.buntel.com/blog/">Tim Buntel</a> wants to find out more about us developers eh? I don't think he knows the madness he is getting himself into! But in the spirit of the "Getting to know you" meme here goes:

<ul>
	
<li> 32 years old.
<li> Living with my girlfriend (who is dammed awesome and plays with guns and guitars).
<li> A car???, I live in London! Are you mad? (although there is a great site called <a href="http://www.streetcar.co.uk/">www.streetcar.co.uk</a> where I can hire a car for a few hours when I need one)
<li> Rent a flat in Greenwich, where the Mean Time comes from.
<li> Mac convert for years, probably first <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2006/3/17/MacBook-Pro-on-its-way">CF Developer to have an Intel Mac</a>, happily codes in most environments as long as I have access to a Mac.
<li> Not sure about cigars, but I did fail to <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/2/I-QUIT">give up smoking</a> this year.
<li> Addicted to <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a>, <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> and <a href="http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/index.jsp">Celebrity Big Brother</a> at the moment (hey! its got <a href="http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/housemate_news.jsp?id=15">Face</a> from the A-Team!)
<li> Apart from watching TV, I spend my time writing an <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">IDE for Coldfusion called CFEclipse</a>
<li> When not doing the above, <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/page.cfm/music">I play guitar</a> and go to gigs, anything noisy with lots of guitars
<li> I love cooking and if I wasn't playing silly buggers with computers I would be a chef
<li> Music tastes vary from the Pixies to the Prodigy, Primal Scream to Pearl Jam, Primus to Portishead. Anything with a P. Apart from Senser who are just magic. Oh.. and Test-Icicles, and Arctic Monkeys...  bah... too many to mention... anything with a good damn beat.
<li> I am bilingual in spanish and english, I grew up in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bl.html">Bolivia</a> you see? I have also lived in Germany and Spain (twice!)
<li> I love London, but would also like to experience living in the USA. Thought San Francisco was great. Haven't been to New York yet (I know!)

</ul>
