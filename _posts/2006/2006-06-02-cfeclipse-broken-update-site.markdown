I am afraid that the update site is a bit broken at the moment, I dont know why, but I am re-doing the update site so the nightly is also there as a BER release so you can get you updates from one place.

Another thing we are doing is setting up, and this might take a while, is an SVN repository and trac system for CFEclipse, so it will make it easier to manage the project and releases as well as for people to submit bugs, we have been wanting to move away from Tigris for a while, so this is the first step... as long as we can get all the CVS repository!

On another note, I have added a black T-shirt to the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cfeclipse">CFEclipse Gear</a> website! So if white is not your colour, then you can also go black :)

Edit: This is in answer to the ASK MD pod by the way!

Also, Han shot first.

Edit 2: I have changed the black t-shirt to have a larger logo, hope you like it (from an ASK MD suggestion!)
