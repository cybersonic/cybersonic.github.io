I have been thinking about doing a major release of CFEclipse but there is a problem. I have mainly been developing the current incarnatino of CFEclipse based on the 3.2 Release Candidate of the Eclipse platform. I know that as soon as I release it there will be problems since people running 3.1 will get some errors (specifically around the editing remote files through the File Explorer view).

This would mean that I would have to branch the project into releases for 3.1 and releases for 3.2 which I am a bit hesitant to do since this would mean a lot more work for me.

So I put it to the community, a release now based on a forthcoming Eclipse release or a 3.1 based release that wont be compatible with 3.2?
