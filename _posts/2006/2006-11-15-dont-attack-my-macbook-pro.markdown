Somewhere between home and work this morning, someone bumped into me... I am sure I didnt drop my bag or do anything dumb like that (no, I was sober this time Andy, so I didnt get attacked by the pavement again). What is left is a massive prang on the corner of my lovely MacBook Pro. 

I just wanted to rant about it... since this baby is my main work and home computer, it does a lot of CF and CFEclipse work and should be treated with due respect ( I know, I know... its only a laptop, but hell, I dont even put stickers on it!)
