I shall finally be presenting ColdSpring and Model Glue 2.0: Unity tonight at the UK CFUG after two (!) re-shedulings, one because I wasnt feeling well that week (oh, the headaches!) and then because of the England game last week (2-0 against Trinidad and Tobago! En-Ger-Laaand!), so its nice to finally do it.

This is going to be an interesting presentation as nearly 90% of it doesnt even touch ColdFusion code but I shall still be creating an application faster than you have ever seen.

This is a definate presentation to get yourself informed on some advanced ColdFusion frameworks that will change the way you code.

Sign up for the presentation over at the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=DFC76F2A-F1FF-921E-1825D894DB19E50A">UKCFUG website</a> and join me and Niklas Richardson for a beer afterwards too!
