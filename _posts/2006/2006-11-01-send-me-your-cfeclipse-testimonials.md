We are currently putting the new CFEclipse.org site together, with a better design, more content, more features and basically nicer look. As part of this, I would love to get some testimonials from either individuals or companies that are using the plugin. As long as we can quote you on the site it would be great if you can give us your (hopefully) positive feedback so we can have a number of quotes and testimonials on how it has improved your coding experience.

Send your testimonials to mark.drew at the well known gmail dot com.

(please dont post them in the comments if you want them to appear in the new site)
