Ok, so you might have noticed I have put some banners on the site, I tend to prefer to add adverts for things I actually like or have some relevance to this blog, but you might notice that I have put a great new banner, the CFEclipse GEAR banner! I kind of like it, even if I say so myself and it reminds people that they can get <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cfeclipse" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/cfegear');">t-shirts, mugs, mousemats and more</a> all nicely decorated with the logo of your <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/cfeclipse');">favourite IDE!</a>
