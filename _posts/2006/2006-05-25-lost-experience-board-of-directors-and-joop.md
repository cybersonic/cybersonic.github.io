I just spotted the following on the RSS feed of <a href ="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/#section=bios">thehansofoundation.org</a>:

<b>Board of Directors updated</b>

Currently the Board of Directors is only seems to be made up of four of the six people that are mentioned. It is all password protected so I assume the news has come on but no more new clues have been given. I havent done a lot of checking yet but something is definately about to happen!

On other news, I also spotted this website: <a href="http://www.savejoop.com/">http://www.savejoop.com/</a> where you can sign a petition to save Joop. It also says that you should email <a href="mailto:hugh.mcintyre@thehansofoundation.org">hugh.mcintyre@thehansofoundation.org</a>
