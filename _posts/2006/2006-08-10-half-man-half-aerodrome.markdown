I spent some time making some tunes in Garageband a while back, which is a lot of fun I have to say, and only re-discovered the tunes recently with a bit of random playing in iTunes.

I thought I would unleash these tunes out under the <A href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/page.cfm/music">half-man/half-aerodrome EP</a>. They are free, and the RIAA wont chase you for them.

Let me know what you think!
