<img src="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/images/cfdevcon-120x120.gif" align="left"> Today is the last day you can order your online tickets for <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/index.cfm">CFDevCon 2006</a>, that is you can get them at the measly price of &pound;49.99 ( about $95), otherwise you can pay &pound;60 ($115) at the door.

This is the first ColdFusion conference I shall be attending in the UK, and more importantly for me (or worryingly!) will be speaking and demonstrating CFEclipse 1.3.

There are also loads of other <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/index.cfm?action=speakers">great speakers</a> ranging from Ben Forta to Charlie Arehart and Nick Tong to name but a few. The topics are varied and very interesting, so make sure you are there!
