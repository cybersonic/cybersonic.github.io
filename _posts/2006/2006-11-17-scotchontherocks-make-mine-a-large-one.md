<a href="http://nil.checksite.co.uk/index.cfm/2006/11/17/Announcing-Scotch-on-the-Rocks-2007">Steven Moretti</a> has just announced that <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks</a>, the Scottish Coldfusion Conference will be happening next year from Thursday May 31st to June 1st!

A few <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/speakers.cfm">speakers</a> have been announced, including yours truly, this is going to be an awesome conference (I might be speaking about CFEclipse, you never know) not least because its another UK based conference but that you also have (a small) chance to watch me be <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/andy/blog/index.cfm/2006/11/10/CFDevCon-The-photos-have-started">attacked by pavements</a> again!

I am still wondering why Andy Allan didnt entertain my suggestion to change the name to <a href="http://www.jackdaniels.com/">Bourbon</a> on the Rocks? After all, its my favourite drink! 

Prices are yet unconfirmed but we are assured they will be sub &pound;100, which for a two day conference is pittance! Even with your international type flights (yes, we welcome Americans! we do!) will make it a fairly cheap conference. (on a similar note, flights from london are &pound;2 and &pound;6 respectively from <a href="http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/index.aspx">BMI</a>)

So, who's coming?
