Within minutes of Kev donating towards the fix of my keyboard, the lovely people at <a href="http://www.capcomms.net/">CAP Communications</a> also gave a donation!

I am now getting closer and closer to meeting the goal so I can get this dammed keyboard fixed! (and track-pad too, so you can see how frustrating if not heavy it is having to carry an extra keyboard and mouse all the time)

Hopefully I can drop it off in the new year (like I am going to drop it off over XMas, yeah right)!

Thanks a lot Cliff!!!
