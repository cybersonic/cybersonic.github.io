I am thinking of re-branding my blog and in the process re-styling it of course, I have come up with a shortlist of designs and in the spirit of community am asking you to choose which one I shall use! I have got a great new domain that I shall be using for this, but I shall keep that as a surprise for the moment (hey, not only <a href="http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=CA4B686A-4E22-1671-58F4E17F09832C78">Damon Cooper</a> can get away with leaving people in suspense!)


I got the designs from <a href="http://www.solucija.com">Solucija</a>. 

So, the choices are:

a) <a href="http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Music/">http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Music/</a>

b) <a href="http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Market/">http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Market/</a>

c) <a href="http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Whats_your_solution/">http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Whats_your_solution/</a>

d) <a href="http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Jobs2/">http://www.solucija.com/templates/demo/Internet_Jobs2/</a>


I shall let your imagination do the work and think how this blog (and more related pages!) will look with these re-designs and look forward to seeing your votes and comments!
