<a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/cfeclipse-contrib/" target="_blank"><img width="150" height="179" border="0" align="left" src="/UserFiles/Image/cfeclipse_rollup.jpg" alt="" /></a> A few people have been wanting to contribute to the CFEclipse project and that is awesome. So to get people started I thought I would point out a few resources and pages that will help.<br /><br />Firstly it does help to join the <a href="http://lists.topica.com/lists/cfeclipse-contrib/" target="_blank">contributors list.</a><br />This is where we discuss what is required and what people would like to add to the project.<br /><br />Your next stop could be to <a href="http://cfeclipse.tigris.org/issues/buglist.cgi?Submit+query=Submit+query&amp;component=cfeclipse&amp;issue_status=NEW&amp;issue_status=STARTED&amp;issue_status=REOPENED&amp;email1=&amp;emailtype1=exact&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;email2=&amp;emailtype2=exact&amp;emailreporter2=1&amp;issueidtype=include&amp;issue_id=&amp;changedin=&amp;votes=&amp;chfieldfrom=&amp;chfieldto=Now&amp;chfieldvalue=&amp;short_desc=&amp;short_desc_type=substring&amp;long_desc=&amp;long_desc_type=substring&amp;issue_file_loc=&amp;issue_file_loc_type=substring&amp;status_whiteboard=&amp;status_whiteboard_type=substring&amp;field0-0-0=noop&amp;type0-0-0=noop&amp;value0-0-0=&amp;cmdtype=doit&amp;order=Issue+Number" target="_blank">read some of the bugs</a> and see if you would like to be able to fix one of them. This would get you used to the code and we can help you get up to speed with the code.<br /><br />Of course, the next stop would be to get the code itself, head over to the documents over at <a href="http://cfeclipse.org/go/documentation/developer-docs/checking-out" target="_blank">cfeclipse.org </a>to let you know how to do this.<br /><br />There is more information about what various bits are of the code do over at <a href="http://www.spike.org.uk/cfeclipse/space/start" target="_blank">Spike's CFEclipse Wiki </a>which we are moving to the new <a href="http://cfeclipse.org/wiki/index.cfm" target="_blank">CFEclipse.org Wikl </a>(hey, that is ONE thing that needs to be done and needs people to help!)<br /><br />So, you have a feature you have added now, or fixed. What do you do? Well, you can create a patch from Eclipse by right clickinng on the file you have changed and going to Team -&gt; Create Patch. This creates a text file that you can then send to a contributor (Myself, Spike or Rob) and we can see if ti works.. test it , give whatever feedback and do a check in into the CVS repository. <br /><br />I am currently looking for another couple of coders so that we can add a few more features and fix some bugs.<br /><br />So now you know how it works... get in touch!<br /><br />
