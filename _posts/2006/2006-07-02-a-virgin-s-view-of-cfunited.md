...or a final wrap up of CFUnited 2006 by a conference first timer.

I have to say that coming to CFUnited has been an amazing experience for me, I got to meet all the people that are involved in the tools I use every day and found out that this is an event not to be missed again (I am starting to save now for next year's CFUnited!) 

Over the last four days I have attended presentations that have given me a more rounded view on programming, met people that I had only known through email or their blogs and drank a boat load of beer (Go Sam Adams!!)

I have also managed to get a bundle of feedback for CFEclipse, so many ideas from so many people (yep, I have been taking notice and I did write down at least 90% of them!) so for the next major version expect to see many new features that will help developers do their job right.

The conference was fantastic, and very well set up, I hear there will be a DVD available so if you didnt make it you can catch up with all the presentations by the speakers, which I very strongly suggest!

Only a couple of niggles which I hope are resolved by next time:
<ul>
   <li>better internet connection: maybe because there were so many people connecting it was hard to get a connection, hence the few posts about the conference</li>
   <li>more power points: I was running around in the afternoons trying to find a power point, there were tables for people to sit round and do some coding, just add a multi socket power point so we are not all dying of power thirst!
</ul>

Now, to start saving for MAX!
