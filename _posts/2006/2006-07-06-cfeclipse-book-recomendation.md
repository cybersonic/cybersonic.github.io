So, you REALLY want to contribute to the CFEclipse project? Dont know where to start? What are all these views, editors and perspectives all about? What in the world is a plugin.xml file all about?

Well, if you want to get started but dont know how to, I can definately recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/032142672X/202-5218834-0604624?v=glance&n=266239">Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality Plug-Ins</a>

I have posted the Amazon.co.uk link but I am sure you can get it in your local country specific amazon store. Its a great well paced book and if you have even a small grasp of Java it will get you along nicely. Well written and following a good example throughout to get you understanding more than the basics. 

I have been reading it whilst over here in the US on my CFUnited/San Francisco holiday and it has given me lots of ideas. It is aimed both at Eclipse 3.1 and 3.2 so some of the new features of 3.2 are there too.

Not too pricey neither for a book that deals with such a narrow subject!

Go get it!
