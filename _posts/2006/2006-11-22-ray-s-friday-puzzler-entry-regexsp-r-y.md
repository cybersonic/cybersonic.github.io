Ray Camden does these <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=search&amp;search=Friday%20Puzzler">Friday Puzzlers</a> to solve some coding problem from time to time, which I generally take interest in, but largely don't take part in, until he posted the challenge to build a RegEx tester, now, I am a terrible RegEx-er. To me it looks like someone bashed the keyboard with the shift key pressed, having said that I need to do a few of them for CFEclipse matching of tags and what not, so I thought I would build one I could have easy access to. You can check it out at <a href="http://markdrew.co.uk/regexspry/index.cfm">http://markdrew.co.uk/regexspry/index.cfm</a> (I recommend having the Live Evaluation ticked on, its nice)

Let me know what you think
