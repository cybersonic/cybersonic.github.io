I was playing around with firefox today, you know the deal, edit code, alt+tab, Ctrl+r to reload the changes. I then needed to see something in the source, so alt+tab, ctrl+r , ctrl+u then ctrl + r to go back to CFEclipse.

I then spotted something by a mistake (damn those sausage fingers of mine!) I alt+tabbed back from CFEclipse and without looking I hit Ctrl+R.... oops.. in the Source View window of firefox... and to my amazement and great gleeful surprise, it reloaded the code! Fantastic!

For those moments that you just want to look at the code ("All I see now is blonde, brunette, redhead." Cypher in The Matrix (1999)) you can just reload it straight from the Source View window. Neat!

I guess I should have expected it to do that... just figured that it wouldnt. 

Not a bad start for a monday!
