Rob Rohan has just started an alternative ad service that can be used instead or with <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a>. <a href="http://www.kalator.com/">Kalator</a> is a project that you can support Open Source projects (like <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFeclipse</a>) by showing adverts for them in your site, as well as (obviously) advertising your own Open Source projects!

I would recomend that if you haven't done so already, <a href="http://www.kalator.com/">you sign up</a> your projects or include it in your AdSense options so you can support the community!
