I have been looking at the Toolbar in CFEclipse, I don't like it. There are a number of reasons for this (it was added to help HomeSite users get used to CFEclipse) and also that we provide so much support that I don't know what an icon can do to help you, but then again, that is just my opinion.

At CFUnited, Dean Harmon and I were talking about it, and he suggested that instead of adding it to the Editor panel, we should break it out to another view, this makes it easier to display it, remove it, and it also maintains state across editors (if you have a snippets tab selected, it will maintain state) rather than each Editor having its own toolbar.

I can break it out and I wanted your opinions, for your viewing pleasure as a compare and contrast I have added some screenshots for you to have a look at.

Let me know what you think? I could also change it so its a "Toolbox" type accordion view (like many other editors that are out there)
