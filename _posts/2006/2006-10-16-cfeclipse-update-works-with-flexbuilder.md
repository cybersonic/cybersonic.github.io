Dean Harmon has been <a href="http://www.cfreport.org/index.cfm/2006/10/12/CFEclipse-13-Beta-and-FlexBuilder">working hard</a> to make sure that CFEclipse and the RDS Plugins that come with Flex Builder work well together. To that end he has managed to refactor some code within CFEclipse so that it will work with Eclipse 3.1 again! Woohoo! This means that CFEclipse 1.3 (beta) is now a plugin that you can use with your standalone version of Flex Builder.

You can get the update over at <a href="http://cfeclipse.org/beta">http://cfeclipse.org/beta</a> (no change in build number, sorry!)
