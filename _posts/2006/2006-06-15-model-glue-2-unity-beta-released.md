An exciting bit of news! Joe Rinehart has finally released <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=D5815F2A-3048-55C9-432B8F55F7D81A87">Model Glue 2: Unity</a> as a beta. This version of MG is very exciting for a few of reasons, 
1) it uses coldspring for its configuration which means you now only need one file to configure Model Glue and Reactor
2) It comes with built-in support for Reactor
3) It does Scaffolding for you! 

This is very neat as a demo but its an awesome feature, you can just define the objects you will scaffold and it will create all the forms and listing pages for you. These can then be copied into your views and modified as you need them. Its a great time saving feature.

It is amaxing to be able to write a whole app without a single line of CF, all is done in the config files. Absolutely awesome!

I shall be demonstrating this on next week's <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=DFC76F2A-F1FF-921E-1825D894DB19E50A">UKCFUG</a> (which was moved from tonight to next week due to the World Cup, or more importantly, England Vs Trinidad & Tobago!!!)
