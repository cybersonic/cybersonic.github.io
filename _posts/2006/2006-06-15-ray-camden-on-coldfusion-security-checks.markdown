Ray has posted a <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/coldfusionsecuritychecklist.cfm">great little guide</a> (not complete but a good outline) of security checks you should do when writing ColdFusion applications. I know there are more items to be added to this list but its a good starting point when you are developing applications.
