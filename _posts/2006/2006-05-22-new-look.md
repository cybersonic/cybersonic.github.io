If you are reading this blog via RSS you wouldnt have noticed but over the weekend I upgraded my blog to Ray Camden's BlogCFC 5. I had been scraping my heels all this time, but its nice to upgrade right?

For you users, I dont think there is anything new, but its nice to have a separate admin. Also it means that I can write stuff, look at it properly and then post it when it needs to be posted.


I put a new look to it, let me know what you think and email me any errors if you see any!
