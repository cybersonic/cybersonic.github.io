Another job has come up at CFEclipse, this one needs zero coding skills in any programming language, only the thing that comes naturally to *most* people out there. Its basically creating an overview list of FAQs. These dont have to be too in-depth but they will go on the new website to help people starting out. I would do this but, rather than being too busy, I am terrible at writing and will spend more time formatting and creating a macro for it than... well... actually writing the stuff!

If anyone is up for it leave me a comment!

If people out there think its a good idea, I could make this as a shared *wiki* style document for people to write? I just need to get a start on it.

(there is a whiteroom document available <a href="http://writeboard.com/3bf8cfebcbc36da30">here</a> ,the password being the same as the project we are talking about)
