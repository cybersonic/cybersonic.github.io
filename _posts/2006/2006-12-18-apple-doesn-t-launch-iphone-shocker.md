<p>Even though there have been rumors amongst digg and the blogsphere that <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/gizmodo-knows-iphone-will-be-announced-on-monday-221991.php">Apple would be announcing the mythical iPhone today</a>, it seems that the rumor was half right, the <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/12/18/linksys_launches_iphone/">iPhone has been released today</a>, but not by Apple, but Linksys.
Ho hum... why would Apple announce something right before Christmas (if they cant sell it) and a month before the usual <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/">MacExpo</a> (when we have the nice keynotes where Steve Jobs does his usual show and tell routine)?</p>
