I recieved my welcome pack yesterday for <a href="http://www.cfunited.com">CFUnited</a> and I must say I am now rearing to go!

This is the first conference of this type I have been to and I am going all out for it! I shall be arriving on the 27th in time for a few beers at the bar, then the four days of fun, cf, and sunshine(?), and then, as if travelling across the atlantic for a conference wasnt enough, I am heading over to San Francisco on the 3rd to spend a week there! East and West coast in one holiday... AWESOME!


I shall be working hard to get a version 1.3 of CFEclipse ready by then as well with some interesting new features and (so far) 50% less bugs!
