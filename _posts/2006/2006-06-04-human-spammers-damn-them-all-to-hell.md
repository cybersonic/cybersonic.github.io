So, I added some more features to make sure that people are actually human when they submit a post to me, so "Bill" from Canada, is sending me spam. For goodness sake, dont be idiots. I just delete the spam, and it has nothing to do with anything I am interestted in. Dont go to all that bother since I wont click on it! 

I mean, I would understand if you are working out of eastern europe or something but you are from Canada and Texas, you understand me... stop it!
