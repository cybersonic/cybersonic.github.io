So, right before Xmas, when everything is closed et-cetera. My laptop keyboard and mouse for my MacBook Pro has bust. It doesn't work. If it was just the mouse it would be ok since I recently got a <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/6664042/wa/PSLID?mco=1643B8F8&amp;nplm=MA272&amp;wosid=nY50AQSxThN42foE2FOWb68HUW0">Wireless Mighty Mouse</a> which is damned neat. But no, its also the keyboard. So, I am carrying my <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/6664042/wa/PSLID?mco=164015FE&amp;nplm=M9270&amp;wosid=nY50AQSxThN42foE2FOWb68HUW0">Bluetooth Keyboard</a> from work home and back every day.

Before our office Christmas party I made an appointment at the Apple Store's Genius bar through the Apple website. After a bit of a wait they finally managed to see me, and even though I am within the warranty period, because my laptop has a dent (that I <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2006/11/15/Dont-Attack-my-MacBook-Pro">mentioned recently</a>) none of it is under warranty and thus, when I get it fixed is going to cost me a cool ?335.05 (or USD 659.30 so you know).

So, not a happy bunny for Xmas, and thus you will all have to wait till I get it fixed (yeah, like I have the cash after Xmas!) till you start getting CFEclipse updates... sorry!
