Brandon Harper over at <a href="http://devnulled.com/">devnulled</a> has released <a href="http://devnulled.com/cfakismet">CFAkismet</a>, a CFC that you can integrate into your own blog to stop comment spam. 

I havent integrated it yet into this blog but judging by the recent trend in comment spamming and subscription spamming it sounds like it would be something very useful to integrate into <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com/">blogCFC</a> or any CF based blog software.

An explenation of what CFAkistmet does from Brandon's CFAKismet page :

<blockquote>
Automattic Kismet (Akismet for short) is a collaborative effort to make comment and trackback spam a non-issue and restore innocence to blogging, so you never have to worry about spam again.

How does it work?

When a new comment, trackback, or pingback comes to your blog it is submitted to the Akismet web service which runs hundreds of tests on the comment and returns a thumbs up or thumbs down.

</blockquote>


I shall try and integrate it and let you know the results!
