I wanted to thank Richard Thibault for sending me a couple of awesome CD's from my Wish List. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000009Q3D/sr=8-5/qid=1154943654/ref=sr_1_5/026-6506556-2821255?ie=UTF8&s=gateway">Erpland</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000060KA6/sr=8-1/qid=1154943948/ref=sr_1_1/026-6506556-2821255?ie=UTF8&s=gateway">Pungent Effulgent/Strangitude</a> by the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search/026-6506556-2821255?search-alias=aps&field-keywords=Ozric%20Tentacles">Ozric Tentacles</a> are some of the best albums I heard in my young life. They changed my attitude when I was in my teens and lead to me having more incence and metal balls (with bells in them) that was probably healthy for me. I followed this band round a lot and saw them more times than I want to count, not including the number of times I bumped into them at festivals. So, as a lot of people would have "Led Zeppelin IV" as the album that really impacted them, for me it was Pungent Effulgent.
So, Richard, a big thanks!!!
