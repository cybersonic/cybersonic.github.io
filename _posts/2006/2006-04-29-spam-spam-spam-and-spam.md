Andy Jarret&nbsp; <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/andy/blog/index.cfm/2006/4/28/Removed-email-subscribers">posted yesterday</a> about strange spammers using his blog's susbscribe by email functionality.<br /><br />I am not sure why you would do this then it hit me, what other good way to get &quot;genuine&quot; emails, since as soon as you post you will be sending these scum a genuine email. <br /><br />I have removed all the subscribers from my database, and also removed the subscribe by email functionality (no one has yet actually subscribed to my blog via email anyway). <br /><br />I have also got an email from supposedly nat west asking me to come in and login to their system to veryfiy against phishing attacks. Riiight... so why are they using a domain that isnt Natwest's?<br /><br />I hate this kind of stuff since I was &quot;nearly&quot; taken in, it has the same font etc as natwest and the link showed the proper email for natwest, but as usual (I always do this) I looked at the source code and the domain was www.natwest-banking *dot* com. A nonexistent domain and definately not the natwest bank.<br /><br />Nigerian scammers, then this... its getting so that you just cant use email anymore!
