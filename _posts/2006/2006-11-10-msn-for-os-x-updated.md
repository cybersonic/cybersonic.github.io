I just spotted that Microsoft have updated MSN for OS X, haven't spotted much of a change yet, but it is finally a Universal Application rather than the old PPC, so it should run a bit faster.

Some of the features it touts are:

<ul>
	<li>Chat with Yahoo contacts (fantastic... right)</li>
	<li>I can have a status message </li>
	<li>You can see what I am listening to (your life must be so boring if you want to know that)</li>
	<li>I can send custom "emoticons" (oh great, I managed to escape those stupid "lol" images by getting rid of windows, now they are back)</li>
	<li>On a plus, I can search through my conversations using Spotlight</li>
	<li>I can write well written messages as it has spell checking</li>
	
</ul>

Don't think it does video, voice or anything useful, once I manage to get MSN and Yahoo via iChat I can remove this puppy.
