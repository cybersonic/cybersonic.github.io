Damon Cooper has a <a href="http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=CA4B686A-4E22-1671-58F4E17F09832C78">heavily commented post</a> asking what people's favourite IDE's and what they would like to see in them. I have been reading the comments and gleaned some features that people would like to see, I shall post a follow up with regards to tackling these features and if they can/cannot be done etc.

So,  in no particular order, here are some of the requested features:
<ul>
 <li>Debugging support</li>
 <li>Defining a &quot;site&quot; with remote and local version</li>
 <li>EVERYTHING that is in HomeSite+ </li>
 <li>BOM for Unicode pages </li>
 <li>Variable insight within a CFC (and I presume CFM page) from Queries</li>
 <li>Right Click to deploy to multiple RDS/FTP servers</li>
 <li>Create a file without actually creating a new file on the file system</li>
 <li>Fixes to colour highlighting   (especially on dark backgrounds)</li>
 <li>Refactoring Support</li>
 <li>Hyperlinking to CFC's and CFC functions  </li>
 <li>Awareness of external CFC's (without definition in code)</li>
 <li>Double click selects a whole tag</li>
 <li>Expression Builder</li>
 <li>Customisable toolbars </li>
 <li>Comparison of remote files </li>
 <li>&quot;How to move to CFEclipse from HomeSite video&quot;</li>
 <li>Customisable hotkeys for snippets</li>
 <li>Integrated Help</li>
 <li>Split Screen</li>
 <li>Customisable Code Colouring</li>
 <li>Stability improvements</li>
 <li>Frameworks Intelligence</li>
 <li>Better file explorer (by name, by date, by type)</li>
 <li>sFTP support </li>
 <li>Code Formatting</li>
 <li>Alternate File System support</li>
 <li>Fix Drag &amp; Drop text</li>
 <li>Fix need to infrequently re-open the file</li>
 <li>Framework functions (create event etc)</li>
 <li>Unit Testing</li>
 <li>&quot;CFEclipse to be like HomeSite+ without the bugs&quot; </li>
</ul>

I shall try to answer my thoughts to all of these over a series of posts and see what people think about them, in the meantime, if there are any more features you can think of, let me know!
