Will global changes in weather cause population centers to shift? Where are new diseases likely to emerge? Which species need protection now before they begin to decline?

If you head to the Mathematical Forecasting Initiative page, you can now see a MFI Forecast Map, which is very interesting apart that it seems some countries (Swipe to see which they are:<font color="white">USA, Italy and Sudan</font>  ) dont have the full details. You could always go and check out the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/">CIA worldbook</a> and get the details you need. Very interesting indeed. I will only post screenshots if you are all "Lost" you know!
