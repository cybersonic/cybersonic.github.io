I mentioned <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2006/7/26/Horses-heads-and-unrefusable-offers">before</a> that I had to pick up something from the post office that was too big to fit through my letterbox last week, well, I picked up another item from my wish list this morning, a Bodum cafetiere!

The people at <a href="http://www.anodyne.com">Anodyne.com</a> a company in Laurel, MD which does Credit Card clearing services as well as web development, design and hosting (sorry if I missed anything else you do!) have been kind enough to get me an item off my wish list!

So a big thanks! It will definitely be well used!

Now to find out who sent me The Godfather for PS2, which I finally managed to start playing yesterday, and got totally hooked... its a great game, without the "usual" key configuration (of pressing X to punch etc) but instead you use the right joystick to "power" your punches and also to shake people to push them into giving you protection money. I can tell I am really going to be getting into this game!
