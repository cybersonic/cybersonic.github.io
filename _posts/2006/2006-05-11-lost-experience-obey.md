As Frebro pointed out in the comments about Alavd Hanso, the words OBEY appear on the clock over at <a href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/www.thehansofoundation.org');">thehansofoundation.org </a>website. It then links you to <a href="http://www.sublymonal.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/www.sublymonal.com');">http://www.sublymonal.com/</a><br /><br />If you click each screen repeatedly you will get a new code: <font color="white">Heir Apparent</font>. (swipe to find out)<br /><br />I tried the newsletter signup, but alas, I just got &quot;no new messages&quot; I wonder where I need to put this in?<br /><br />UPDATE: Go to the Executive Bios and click on Dr Thomas Mittlewek, enter the code and you will be presented with some interesting information.<br /><br /><br />Also, login box... I wonder if we can try logging in using one of the emails of the presidents?
