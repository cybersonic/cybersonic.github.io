I just wanted to say that I have now done over 200 posts in this blog, I have been blogging for nearly three years and have recieved (acording to the blog stats) over 50,000 visits to my blog. Wow, I know its not a lot compared to say <a href="http://corfield.org/">Mr Corfield's</a> or <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com">Mr Camden's</a> blogs but I am still proud of this little milestone!

So here, I raise my coffee cup to another three years of blogging and another few hundred posts and thank you all my readers!
