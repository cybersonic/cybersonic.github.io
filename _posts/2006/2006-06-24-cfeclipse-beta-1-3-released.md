I have just put an area for you to download CFEclipse 1.3 Beta for testing. I thought I would get it all ready for CFUnited (did I mention I am finally going?)

You can go and get it over at <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/beta">http://www.cfeclipse.org/beta</a>

Let me know how you get on! I have been working hard to resolve people's issues.

One big note I would say is that it REQUIRES Eclipse 3.2  which you can get over at <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.php">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.php</a>

Enjoy!
