As you might notice, I have a nice shiny iTunes logo under the RSS &amp; Podcasts pod! The iTunes people added my podcast pretty quickly too! which was pretty awesome. Now I have to make sure all the details are right and they get a nice picture and everything.<br /><br />If you want to subscribe to my podcast, all you have to do is either click the logo or click <a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/itunes');" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=152536611&amp;s=143444" target="_blank">here</a>!
