I shall be presenting tonight at the UK CFUG, and showing all the new features in CFEclipse that we have been developing over the last couple of months.<br /><br />I shall also be presenting something pretty exciting, the RDS plugin for Eclipse by Adobe. This is a great place to preview the plugin since it is still in alpha stage but looking very good so far!<br /><br />We will be trying to record the audo tonight so that we can put together a nice presentation for you later on if you are unable to attend (whats your excuse??.. ok ok.. wrong country!)<br /><br />You can register for the event here: <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org" target="_blank">http://www.ukcfug.org</a>
