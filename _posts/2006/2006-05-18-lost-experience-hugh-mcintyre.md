Looks like the compass led to Hugh McIntyre's details... if you look around his email, there is a<a href="http://www.letyourcompassguideyou.com/usr/pthompso/mail/INBOX" target="_blank"> binary code</a> that you can decipher, its also in one of the images (not sure what the Jeep's have to do with) but when you go back to his profile and enter the secret code (swipe to see it): <font color="white"> the mouth piece </font> you then get more details about this &quot;Deeply commited to family values&quot; kind of guy.<br /><br />Curiouser and curiouser.<br /><br />Then again, all this is more to do with the Hanso foundation more than the Lost Islanders. I know they are interelinked.<br /><br /><img width="190" height="129" align="left" alt="" src="/UserFiles/Image/compass_password.png" />As an aside, I was looking at the <a target="_blank" href="/UserFiles/Image/lostClue4.png">screenshot </a>that I took of the compass when it reveals and I found a little clue or password. not sure what that is about.<br /><br />But I read it as D I 9 F F T R 7 3 1. I tried it in the login boxes but nothing. Although the last 3 could be a 5, but that didnt give any results neither.<br /><br />If anybody has any ideas, let me know!
