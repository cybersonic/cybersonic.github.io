Cliff has graciously sent me an item from my amazon wish list. This is an awesome turn up for the books! Two items in one week! Fantastic!<br /><br />Dub Side of the Moon is&nbsp; a cover of the famous Pink Floyd album Dark side of the moon (surprise, surprise). I have been listening it non-stop today and its superb! Most of the songs are done in a great half-beat dub that just turns the moody album into the most chilled strolling album ever.<br /><br />On the Run is also great, they have changed the machine noises into a great drum and bass ditty that just works perfectly!<br /><br />So here's to you Cliff!<br /><br />Jah Rule!<br /><br />MD
