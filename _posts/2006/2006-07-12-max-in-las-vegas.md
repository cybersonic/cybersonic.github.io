I know this must be late, but I am just getting back into the swing of things after my holiday in San Francisco (great city! photos coming soon!) but I see that they have finally put up info on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">MAX conference in Las Vegas</a> over at the Adobe site.

After CFUnited and the buzz I got from going to such a gathering I would love to go to MAX, but alas, it is out of my reach, a bit of maths tells me that:

Ticket for Max: $1,095
Travel : $2,565.78
Hotel : $2,145.00

So, we are talking at a base-line $5805.78 (or 3,162.00 GBP) for me to go to MAX. As much as I would love to, and apart from any "expenses" that I might incur (I hear JD might be a bit expensive in Vegas), it looks like for me its a no-no.

Ho hum. Its crap in London at the end of October but I am sure I can manage it.
