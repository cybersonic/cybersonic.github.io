Just a quick post to say that I haven't disappeared. I have been very busy on a project at work, despite of this I managed to head off to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markdrew/sets/72157594259378462/">Reading Music Festival</a> for the weekend and come back to a heap of work. CFEclipse is on pause this week and I shall take up the reins this weekend and hopefully have a 1.3 RC by next week (there I go, overpromising again!)
