<a href="http://www.cfreport.org/index.cfm/2006/10/12/CFEclipse-13-Beta-and-FlexBuilder">Dean Harmon</a> from Adobe helped the CFEclipse team last week by providing a version of CFEclipse Beta 1.3 that would run on Eclipse 3.1. Since then a few users have mentioned that they have had problems with the syntax highlighting and tag assist. 

I have uploaded a new version of the plugin to the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/beta">cfeclipse.org/beta</a> site that should fix these errors. Basically installations of CFEclipse need to be an unpacked Jar, and the version that we (or rather *I*) put up was a Jar'd plugin. A big thanks to Teddy Payne for helping me test this (not running 3.1 and all!).

The new version is an extracted jar, that you need to unzip and put in your plugins directory. It should fix all those annoying bugs.
