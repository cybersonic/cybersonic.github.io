I don't normally go off-topic on my blog, but this weekend whilst recovering from <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com">CFDEVCON</a> I managed to plough my way through the whole of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0715635964/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/202-5218834-0604624">World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War</a>. This is really an awesome book despite the "trashy" title.

Set a few years after a world-wide epidemic of (you guessed it) Zombies, the author interviews people that were affected by the War, and covers their recollections. Starting with the first (surviving) person to discover the start of the outbreak in China via various people along the path of the infection it offers a second hand series of stories that are absolutely compelling.

I was glued to this book and completely recommend it. It feels like a history book with the reactions of each of the characters as well as their opinions grounded in reality. 

A Must Read!
