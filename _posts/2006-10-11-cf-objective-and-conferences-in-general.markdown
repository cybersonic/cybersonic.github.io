Well, looks like MAX will be happening soon, and Jared has just announced that <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cf.Objective 2007</a> is a go! All very exciting!!! I would have loved to make it to MAX but I live in London, and Vegas is a tad far away (two trips to the US in one year is far to expensive!) but I am really looking forward to next year, hopefully I shall be able to make it to a couple of conferences out there. 

But lets not forget that in November we have <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com/">CFDevCon</a> happening here in the UK! Finally a conference here in the UK, alebeit a small one but its a start at least!

Let me know if you are coming to CFDevCon, I shall be speaking (just for an hour, not my usual marathon 2 hours) showing some features of CFEclipse that people might not know.

On that note, tonight I shall be speaking at the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=F222A9C0-F1FF-921E-187AEE9C4C78347D">Thames Valley CFUG</a> and showing some of the new features of CFEclipse, come along!
