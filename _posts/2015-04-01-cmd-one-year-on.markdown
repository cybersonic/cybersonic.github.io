<p>Hello Internet</p>

<p>I know it has become a bit of a tradition for me to announce things on the 1st of April. This year it will be slightly different. It will be a good news post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started <a href="http://charliemikedelta.com">CMD</a> one year ago today and have to say that it has been one of the most fun years I have had.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">On a personal level, I got married, bought a house and had an awesome honeymoon in Cancun.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">On a professional level, <a href="http://charliemikedelta.com">CMD</a> has thrived in the year, we have manged to pay wages, sponsor conferences and even had some awesome swag produced.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">We have had some great clients, we also some interesting products in development and&nbsp;we will be attending &nbsp;dev.objective() in May which I hope to meet up with faces old and new.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">I am totally looking forward to the next year!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Cheers!</span></p>
