Well, I am finally online and really looking forward to the second day at CFUnited. Yesterday was a long and thoroughly enjoyable day, it was great to finally meet up with a lot of the people I have been talking to for the last year or two and talk to them in the flesh (and drink and smoke with them too!)

Apart from a number of fantastic presentations I attended , the most notable was the announcement that Tim Buntel is back at Adobe! He had left earlier this year but now he is back as the Product Marketing Manager for the ColdFusion team! This is an awesome turn up for the books! Keep your eyes peeled for a lot more ColdFusion action over the next few months!

I shall be posting photos, once I remember to bring the dammed cable :)

by the way, if anyone is looking for me... I am usually outside smoking... (the one in the CFEclipse t-shirt)
