I got back home last night from the <a href="http://www.diesel-u-music.com/">Diesel-U-Music</a> Urban Music Finalists showcase in Notting Hill (I developed some of the site and my girlfriend was taking photos) to find an Amazon package waiting for me! Ohh! I want to thank <a href="http://inner-rhythm.co.uk/blog/">Big Kev</a> for getting  me some awesome stuff from my wish list, I got a couple of John Constantine/HellBlazer books (one graphic novel and a book to be brecice) as well as the PC game F.E.A.R.

If anyone asks, I am busy this weekend! 

THANKS BIG KEV!
