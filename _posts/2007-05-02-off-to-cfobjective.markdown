Well, not quite, but I shall be heading out tomorrow morning. I wanted to know if any other people are arriving at the Minneapolis/St Pauls airport around 15:30 (or 3:30 pm, whichever is easiest) and we can share a taxi (or shuttle bus if I phone *NOW*)?

Any brits going? Would hate to be on the same flight as another candidate and not say hello at least! (or get drunk before taking off, cause havoc on the plane and be arrested on landing, you know, the usual)

That 8 hour plane ride should give me some time to finish off some code on Project U at least!
