Apple have released <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">BootCamp</a> that allows you to run Windows on your MacBook Pros. No more doing some crazy fool stuff and spending hours trying to install stuff... <br /><br />Donwloading it now!.<br /><br />Edit::: <a href="/UserFiles/File/WindowsMacBookBoot.mov" target="_blank">Here is a video of restarting my MacBook from OSX to Windows XP</a><br />Keep in mind that I had to reboot so if it seems slow, its cos its from a running Mac to a started up window XPs machine. I have done a bit of work on it today and it runs very nicely (better than my desktop) <br /><br />Tonight I shall see if I can install some games on it! FarCry! Doom 3!, Half Life 2! Woohoo!
