Do you need someone to present at your CFUG? Well, I have been doing a lot of presentations lately, which can be seen over in my <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/page.cfm/presentations" title="Mark Drew - cf_etc...: Presentations">Presentations</a> page, which means I have a lot of content I can present on. If you have a specific topic (including <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org" title="CFEclipse: The ColdFusion IDE for Eclipse">CFEclipse</a> of course!) Why not <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/page.cfm/contact" title="Mark Drew - cf_etc...: Contact">email</a> me with your proposal and I shall see what I can do.

I am based in London, England so unless there is a nice budget to fly me out, I can also do remote presentations using Adobe Connect. I am available in the evenings mostly so let me know if you ever need an extra presenter at your CFUG or company.
