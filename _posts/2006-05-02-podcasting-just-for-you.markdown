From ... me! I am now going to be doing some podcasts mainly presenting CFEclipse and Coldfusion notes and rambles, plus other things I hope. This is mainly a way of publishing some of the presentations that I have been doing so there will be video podcasts (vodcasts) as well as your &quot;standard&quot; voice based ones.<br /><br />The first podcast that you can get by susbcribing to the link under RSS &amp; Podcasts on the second pod on the right, has the first part of my Model-Glue presentation at the UK CFUG.<br /><br />If you use iTunes (which I recomend!) copy the link and use the Advanced -&gt; Subscribe to podcast menu item and paste in the following RSS feed: <a href="http://markdrew.libsyn.com/rss" target="_blank">http://markdrew.libsyn.com/rss</a>. The nice thing about the first podcast is that it gives you all the slides within the podcast as well as links to each of the items (this works well in iTunes) <br /><br />Let me know what you thnk and submit any ideas of what you would like to have on the podcast!<br /><br />(you can of course, go straight to the podcast by clicking <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/markdrew/MG_ReactorPresentation_part01.m4a" target="_blank">here</a>)
