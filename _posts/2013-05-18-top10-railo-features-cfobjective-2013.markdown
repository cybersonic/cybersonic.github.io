<p>Before I forget, I thought I would point you to the code that I used to do my Top 10 Railo features presentation. </p>
<p>The presentation was actually written using the features and hence there are no slides as such, since it's a living presentation/document that I might add more features of bug fixes to. Hence it's also under version control over in GitHub! </p>
<p>Go check out the code yourself: <a href="https://github.com/cybersonic/railo-top10-features">https://github.com/cybersonic/railo-top10-features</a> and let me know what you think. </p>
