For those of you who attended my FreshAir presentation at Scotch on the Rocks, firstly, an apology about the wireless. My presentation was going swimmingly until I hit a problem with the firewall that stopped "json" requests to twitter, which meant that you couldn't see the listing coming through!

I have posted my code here for you to have a look at as well as the presentation itself so you can work your way through it.

Let me know what you think! And I hope at least, problems notwithstanding, that you enjoyed the presentation and found it useful!

Unzip the sample code and use Eclipse's/Aptana Studio's "Import... -> Existing Projects" feature to get it going.
