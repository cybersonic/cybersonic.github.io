I found a great <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apelad/sets/72157594388426362/
">series of images</a> to represent HTTP Status Codes via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/08/cartoons_for_http_er.html">boing boing</a> today, which is highly relevant to what I am doing at the moment, which is load testing a website that is mis-behaving. 

Very funny, and very useful. I guess the next topic would be how to change your status code handler in Apache!
