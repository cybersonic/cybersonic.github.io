Finally I have moved over from Blogger to my own site using Ray Camdens's BlogCFC.

I wanted to have more control over what I publish etc so its good to have a base on technology that I can change and add features that I want to!

First off you can see the search feature, and a nice navigation at the top (which I shall be assigning all previous posts to in due time) 

Let me know what you think and if you can actually see this!
