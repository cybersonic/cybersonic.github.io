I know this has been used to death and there are a bazillion applications out there to do this, but usually you need to do this on the client side. I decided to add a very handsome photo of myself to this site as my little icon on the URL bar, so I went on a search for an app to do it.

No need, I found <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/"> http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/</a> , a site that allows you to upload your icon and it will give you a nice icon to use on your site, as well as checking it once you have uploaded. Super neat!
