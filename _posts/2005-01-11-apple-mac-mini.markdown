Imagine a PC smaller than a Shuttle mini. the Apple Mac mini is something that Apple had to do. Its a replacement for your old (or hell! new!) PC that integrates with all the peripherals (yes including your old monitor). So. a new mac machine.. whats so good about it? its 2 inches high by  6.5 inches wide and deep. That is small but it just looks sooo lovely! Great to go with your IPod

And no, it doesnt stop there, they have also introduced a 99 USD Ipod called the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">IPod Shuffle</a>. This is up to a Gig of space for all your songs that are played in a chewing gum sized package. This is so awesome I am constraining myself in this post

I shall write more when I have got myself together.
