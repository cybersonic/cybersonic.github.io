I was bashing away at the web as you do, and I spotted an interesting feature in Firefox and tables. You are able to select individual (and multiple) cells from a table by pressing the CTRL (or Apple key on OS X) as you hit a table cell, go ahead and try below (if you are watching this in Glorious Firefox-Vision)
<table border="1" width="340" ><tr><td><strong>Select Me </strong></td><td>Not me </td><td><strong>Select Me </strong></td></tr><tr>  <td>Not me </td>  <td><strong>Select Me </strong></td>  <td>Not me </td></tr><tr>  <td><strong>Select Me </strong></td>  <td>Not me </td>  <td><strong>Select Me </strong></td></tr><tr>  <td><strong>Select Me </strong></td>  <td>Not me </td>  <td><strong>Select Me </strong></td></tr></table>
Any other features that people have come across...post them here!
