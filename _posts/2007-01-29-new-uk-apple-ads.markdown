I just spotted that Apple has done some UK specific adverts using <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/">Mitchell and Web</a> (the guys behind "That Mitchell and WEbb Look" funnily enough).

Some of them are copies of the American ads, I just spotted a double page spread in the <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/">Metro</a> this morning and lo and behold they are on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/">Apple UK site</a>!
