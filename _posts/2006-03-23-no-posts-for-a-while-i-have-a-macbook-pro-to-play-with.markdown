I just got my MacBook Pro so I shall be spending time playing with that instead of anything so much as interesting like interacting with humans and things like that.<br /><br />I am astounded at how easy it was to transfer from my other laptop. You just start up the original laptop into Firewire mode (on startup press T), plugin your Firewire cable from one laptop to the other and run /Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant and about an hour and 50Gb of transfer later, I log into my old account on the new laptop and all is as usual, including my old applications! Awesome.<br /><br />So, now with my new &quot;Contributing to Eclipse&quot; and an awesome screen I am as happy as larry for the coding.<br /><br />(check out the screenshot of eclipse, I shall put another one tonight of eclipse on my old laptop)<br />The MacBook Pro<br /><a target="_blank" href="/UserFiles/Image/Picture_3.png"><img width="100" height="62" border="0" alt="Image of my new desktop" src="/UserFiles/Image/mbp_thumb.png" /></a><br />And the old PowerBook<br /><a href="/UserFiles/Image/cf_pb.png" target="_blank"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="/UserFiles/Image/cf_pb_thmb.png" alt="" /></a>
