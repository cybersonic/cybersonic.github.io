I just wanted to post a note that this morning I did a release of CFEclipse 1.3.1.6. This is a bug-fix release, and has no extra features and is geared at some specific bugs:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/332#" title="#332 (File Explorer Doesn't Show Sub-Folders after upgrading to 1.3.1.5) - CFEclipse Plugin - Trac">332 (File Explorer Doesn't Show Sub-Folders after upgrading to 1.3.1.5)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/368" title="#368 (Passive FTP is not enabled) - CFEclipse Plugin - Trac">368 (Passive FTP is not enabled)</a></li>
	<li>CFEclipse has now been compiled to comply with Java 1.4 (so if you are getting odd errors about major minor versions this should do the trick)</li>
</ul>

Its a very small release but people have been complaining about the FileExplorer so I thought I would get this version out.

There are no other changes, so if these issues do not affect you, you do not need to upgrade.
