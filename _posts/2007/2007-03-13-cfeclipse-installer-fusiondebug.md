I posted about this before, but apart from the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/download/">All-in-One</a> version of CFEclipse I am testing out, you can also get CFEclipse bundled with FusionDebug as an complete installer for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and even Solaris!

You can check it out at <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/downloads.php">FusionDebug</a>

It comes with a trial version of FusionDebug, but even after the trial times out, you have a fully working version of Eclipse and CFEclipse. See, how much easier can we make it for you?
