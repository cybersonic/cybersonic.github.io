I just had to upgrade to <a href="http://blogcfc.riaforge.org/">BlogCFC 5.5.1</a> which caused a few errors (partial uploading was the error rather than anything else). Hopefully everything is back to normal.

I have also been thinking I might do a bit of a re-design of the blog... what do you think? Any ideas?
