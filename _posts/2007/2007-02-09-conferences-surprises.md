As some of you might have spotted, I have put up a couple of banners for <a href="http://http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/">cfObjective</a> and <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks</a>. The reason for this is that is, surprise surprise, that I shall be presenting <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> at these conferences!

I haven't put up a banner for <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/2007/">CFunited</a> yet, but I shall also be presenting there too, definately a busy summer for me.

To make it even more exciting (more? how much more exciting can it get?), I shall be presenting a brand new feature of CFEclipse at each of these conferences. I can't tell you what they are yet, but they are going to be some nice additions to <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>. Not only that, but <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/2007/">CFunited</a> will be when we unveil CFEclipse 1.4! (no coldfusing marketing campaign this time)!


How about THAT for an incentive to go?


Edit: did anyone spot the donate button by the way? :)
