Now, here is an offer you can't refuse! <a href="http://inner-rhythm.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/20/My-Scotch-on-the-Rocks-Pledge">Kev is going to give away 25 british pounds</a> (that is like $5000 or something) to tickets number 75 and 100 for <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks</a>!

This is a great conference, and you should tell everyone you work with and other ColdFusion developers that are not in the community about this.

Scotch will be a great conference, here in our UK backyard of Scotland, cheap as chips too at only ?80 odd quid to attend two jam packed days of conference! 

No excuses now, and you can even get yourself a few drinks thanks to Kev! 

What other conference gives you money eh?
