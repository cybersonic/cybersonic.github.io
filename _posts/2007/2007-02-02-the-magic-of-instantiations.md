The wonderful guys and gals at <a href="http://www.instantiations.com/index.html">Instantiations</a>, the makers of a fantastic development tools for Eclipse plugin developers, have donated a copy of <a href="http://www.windowbuilderpro.com/">Windowbuilder Pro</a> to the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFeclipse Project</a>

What does this mean? Well, one of the things that *REALLY* slows me down is doing some panels and views in Eclipse, I just want to do it easily and it isn't so, with <a href="http://www.windowbuilderpro.com/">Windowbuilder Pro</a> I can develop new features a LOT faster, and that really means a lot, since I can only really develop CFEclipse for a few hours at a time.

I really would like to recommend them not only on the kindness of the donation but on the speed that they got back to me. It really shows great service!
