After a year of development, countless bugs fixed, a number of features added, CFEclipse 1.3 has finally been unleashed!

<more />

It has taken a while I have to admit, but we have finally released CFEclipse 1.3 onto the update site, you can get this release by using Eclipse's Software Update feature (help -> Software Updates -> Find and Install... ) and add http://www.cfeclipse.org/update/ as a remote update site.


There will be a couple more announcements over the next few days, so keep alert!  I also promise to start writing about the new features in this release and the upcoming schedule of releases over the coming year.

As a side note, you don't need to be coldfused anymore!
