I have been back from the cfObjective conference in Minnesota for a few days and it has allowed me to reflect a bit on how awesome a conference it was. Everything was spot on, the speakers, the venue, the food, the Jack Daniels (thanks to the <a href="http://www.coldfusionweekly.com/">ColdFusion Weekly </a>guys for the bottle of Gentleman Jack!)! 

The CFEclipse presentation had a great turn out too, so much so that Jared had to move us into the main presentation room. I was astounded when I asked how many people used CFEclipse and nearly everyone put up their hands!

Finally being able to show the world the CF Frameworks Explorer was the highlight of my presentation. I am over the moon with the positive feedback, and for those that are experiencing bugs with it, don't worry, its in VERY active development! You can download it from the CFEclipse Update Site (http://www.cfeclipse.org/update) but also remember that you need to update your copy of CFEclipse too.

If you are just getting started with it, I have updated the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=TV">CFEclipse TV</a> section of the CFEclipse website with a quick introduction to the frameworks explorer. 

With <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks</a> round the corner, I wanted to announce that Project:X will be demonstrated at Scotch on the Rocks. This is the only place that you will be able to see the unveiling of what I must say is going to be a fantastic addition to the CFEclipse project. It will REALLY speed up your development and is a perfect companion to the CF Frameworks Explorer. 

If that wasn't enough, I have just been informed by Andy Allan that there will be <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/9/Free-Beer-at-Scotch-on-the-Rocks">FREE Beer</a> ("free as in beer" beer) at a conference that is a must if you are anywhere near Europe. It is very inexpensive for a conference with the quality of speakers that you would get at something double the size. If you haven't booked a place yet, get to it! I cannot stress enough about how much a conference of this quality goes to make you a better developer. If you think a couple of days away from work is too much to gain this kind of knowledge, then you don't deserve a pay raise.
