If anyone knows me, they will know I am into my Graphic Novels, I am a big fan of Garth Ennis' Preacher (loved that series!), Hell Blazer (ok ok, Constantine you Hollywoodized Harlots!) Frank Miller (going to see the 300 this weekend, and no Spartan can stop me!) and the truly awesome Alan Moore. 

I just found out through the digg-vine that the director of the 300 will be making Watchmen! Check out the <a href="http://www.reelzchannel.com/moviedetail.aspx?movieid=223693&clipid=18326">interview!</a>.

This leaves me both excited and scared. All recent attempts at Moore's films have turned out parodies that have completely missed the point of the original novel, Johnny Depp's stupid Laandaan accent in From Hell and  the complete parody that was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

I can see why Frank Miller put a stop to any of that malarkey and only let Robert Rodriguez make Sin City by becoming a co-director of the film (and after Rodriguez made a short film to show Miller the potential).

Now, I recently re-read (for like the 10th time) Watchmen, and its an interesting story with many subtleties and issues that I hope don't get completely lost. If you were to flick through Watchemen the visual style (all these over the hill superheroes) is not something that would look that alluring on film, or at least, something that could be completely done wrong. 

The back story of some of the characters really add to the story and that is what I think wont make it to the film, so I just hope that Zack Snyder will be able to translate such a big story.

On another note, they will be making Preacher as a <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/news/spider-mannews.php?id=4949">TV Series</a>! Well done! A nine book epic such as this cant be turned into 90 minute film, no way, no how bubba.

Of course, that is what they should be doing with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/">World War Z</a>, do it something like Band of Brothers format, but alas, looks like Brad Pitt is going for the easy money in a film version.
