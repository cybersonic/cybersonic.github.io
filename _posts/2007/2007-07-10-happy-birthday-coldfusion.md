Look at you! How you've grown! You are able to play with the big boys now, in the J2EE world, you can do AJAX very skillfully, and can even connect to Bill's Exchange server.

I know it has been a few tough years to get people to take you seriously but now you have managed to make it into the stratosphere. Every passing year you have learned new skills, become more structured with all your frameworks and even passed your teenage years from being based on C and grown into a little Java master.

So here is to you, your first pint as an adult... Happy Birthday ColdFusion!
