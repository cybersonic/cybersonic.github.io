I just wanted to send out a big thank you to whoever sent me the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eidos-Reservoir-Dogs-PS2/dp/B000197Z5S/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4/203-9241999-0683963?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1181730538&sr=8-4">Reservoir Dogs PS2</a> Game! 

It is very appreciated when I get a mystery gift through the post, of course, the only problem (or benefit depending on your point of view) is that when Amazon sends a Wish List item, it doesn't tell you who is from. But CFEclipse user... I thank you and salute you!

(Oh, I added some more items to my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/622WQR01XXWO">Wish list</a> finally! ... not that I am hinting or anything!)
