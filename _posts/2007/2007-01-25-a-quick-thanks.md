I just wanted to say a quick thanks to <a href="http://www.ryanguill.com/">Ryan Guill</a> for his very kind donation to the <strong>CFEclipse Conference Fund!</strong>.

This fund allows me to travel (the not so small distance) to the conferences this year, both to present CFEclipse to fellow ColdFusion Developers and be able to meet and get feedback from the best community out there, the ColdFusion developer community!


Thanks again Ryan!!!
