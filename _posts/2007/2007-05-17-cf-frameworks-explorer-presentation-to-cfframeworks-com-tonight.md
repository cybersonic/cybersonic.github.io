How is that for a mouthful of a title? I shall be speaking tonight at 7pm GMT (2pm EST) with Nick Tong from <a href="http://www.cfframeworks.com">cfframeworks.com</a> about the newly released CF Frameworks Explorer for CFEclipse.

Its one of these new fangled Adobe Connect rooms,  you can join in by going here: <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/frameworksexplorer/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/frameworksexplorer/</a>

(hopefully it will be recorded so if you cant make it tonight, you can watch it in your own time)On another note, I have been very busy at work and at home recently, getting ready for <a href="http://scotch.scottishcfug.com/">Scotch on the Rocks </a> as I shall be doing two presentations there, during which, I recently spotted that a lot of donations have been coming through PayPal! I wanted to thank everyone for your continued support! This really helps, I have been able to pay for the flight to Scotland and much of the cost of cfObjective! Thank you everyone!!!

And another thank you has to go to whoever sent me the PSP game "From Russia With Love", unfortunately Amazon doesn't print  who sent it to me on the invoice so I don't know who to thank personally... but hopefully you read this blog so, THANKS! (thoroughly enjoying it on the train ride home)
