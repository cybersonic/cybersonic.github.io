I am doing a presentation for the <a href="http://www.cfug.co.nz/">Auckland (that's New Zealand!) CFUG</a> on Thursday this week about <a href="http://cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>. If you are interested in getting started using the CFEclipse plugin for Eclipse, this is the presentation for you!

Unfortunately I wont be there in person (maybe next time guys!) but it will be in one of these new fangled Adobe Connect rooms, which means you can join if you head to : <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfeclipse/">http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/cfeclipse/ </a>

The time for the meeting is 6am GMT, 6pm NZ time, 1am EST, 10pm PST and a whole lot of other times around the world (go on, figure it out!)

For those safely tucked up in bed at that time, I am pretty sure they will be recording the presentation so you don't have to be up at some ungodly hour!
