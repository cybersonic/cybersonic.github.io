We have added a new video to the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">cfeclipse.org</a> site, How to work with Local History. This is a great way to manage versions of a file without hooking up to a Version Control system (of course its not a replacement but it can get you out of trouble)

You can check out the video at <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&page=TV">CFEclipse TV</a>

Another update is that we have added an RSS feed to the site, you dont have to depend on me telling you when we have added videos or news anymore!

You can subscribe to it here:

If you have any problems or suggestions, let me know!
