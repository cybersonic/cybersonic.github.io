As the CFEclipse project grows, both in terms of features and number of users, I would like to "hire" someone that will be in charge of the testing and QA group. This role would not take a lot of your time, maybe a couple of hours a week, maybe more if a lot of features are going in.

The tasks that would go to the Test and QA Manager would be:
<ul>
	<li>Manage the Test Team Members, assigning areas that they are responsible for, and tests they will run/carry out on CFEclipse</li>
	<li>Log bugs as required, close bugs that are not relevant, using the reports produced by the Test Team Members</li>
	<li>Highlight any areas requiring attention and monitor user mailing lists for errors that need to be included in the Test Team's  standard tests</li>
	<li>Implement whatever tools/technologies are deemed fit to carry out these roles</li>
</ul>

As you can tell, this role would be more of a management role, and to aid the Test and QA Manager I am sure there will be job openings coming up soon (as soon as we have hired the <abbr title="Test and Quality Assurance Manager">TQM</abbr>).

The remuneration of the role would be to officially become a member of the CFEclipse Crew, and your photo and bio be added to the CFEclipse website.

To apply for this role, send me an <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:znex\056qerj\100tznvy\056pbz\">rznvy<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c)\{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script>, saying what you think you can bring to this role, and how much time you can devote to this task.


P.S. in case you are an agency, before you start calling me, this is a volunteer role and there is no money involved.
