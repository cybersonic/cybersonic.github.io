So, some news in sequence, I have booked my hotel for <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cfObjective</a> as well as the flight! So a big thank you to all that have donated, the money has been well spent on the conference "tour" of the summer.

Project:U is coming along, those on the prerelease should expect a drop sometime later this week.

I am also strangely enough, getting ready the presentation for <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/">CFUnited</a> (they have to be in pretty sharpish if I am to go there!) which is also timely as I shall be presenting for the <a href="http://www.cfug.co.nz/cfug/">Auckland CFUG</a> this Thursday (at 6:00 am, how is that for dedication to the cause?), I shall post the Connect room URL when I know it.

On other, related, presentation news, I just got my little "<a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/23/MacBook-naming-competition#c7FDC9DDB-1143-DB28-3A249A672E360791">Monolith</a>" MacBook that will be coming along with me on tour. I am installing it with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">BootCamp</a> (partitions can be run from <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>, I also wanted to give it a test before I add too much stuff to this machine) and Parallels as well as ColdFusion, iWork and CFEclipse. All ready to present I hope!

At the same time I got the MacBook delivered, I got my PSP returned to me! Well, kinda, the PSP was replaced since it wasn't loading UMDs anymore which defeats the point of having a PSP! But alas it is back and I shall be checking it out tonight. Fun Fun Fun!

Plenty of news, more to come this week!
