Alistair Davidson just put a <a href="http://instantbadger.blogspot.com/2007/01/fed-ex-social-engineering-id-theft-scam.html">blog post</a> about a fed-ex scam, now,  I leave the details up to him but has anyone in the US ever had to give the recipients date of birth when sending a Fed-Ex package? And if someone phoned you claiming to be from FedEx would you give them all your details just like that?

Another part that sounds dodgy is the "cash on delivery" for a package you don't know who its from.

This sounds as dodgy as can be, so watch out for scams like this.

I have a feeling the world is changing with regards to the lengths people are going to scam other's identity.
