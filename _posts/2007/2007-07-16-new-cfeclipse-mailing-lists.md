Following Charlie Arehart's great list of CFEclipse <a href="http://carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2007/7/10/come_read_70_CFEclipse_bloggers" title="Come read over 70 CFEclipse bloggers - Part 1 - Charlie Arehart's Blog">blogs</a> and resources, I thought I would mention to the world at large the new (and old) mailing lists that are available for CFEclipsers.


<ul>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-users" title="CFEclipse Users |
	  Google Groups">CFEclipse Users</a>: This is the main place to ask questions and provide support to people using CFEclipse</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-dev" title="CFEclipse Developers |
	  Google Groups">CFEclipse Developers</a>: This is for developers that are writing or want to write code for CFEclipse itself.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-testers">CFEclipse Testers</a>: This is a closed group for people that want to regularly test features of CFEclipse. Joining this group means you want to actively be a tester, so no support questions, but submissions of test results etc.</li>
	<li>And finally, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-snipex" title="CFEclipse Snipex |
	  Google Groups">CFEclipse SnipEx</a>: This is a group for developers of SnipEx services. If you like SnipEx and want to talk about how to code it or integrate it, here is the place to go to.</li>
</ul>

EDIT: 
I forgot to mention the House of Fusion's <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cfeclipse/">General CFEclipse mailing</a> list! 

If you are still subscribed to a group in tigris.org, then you shall soon be unsubscribed as those groups will be deleted soon.
