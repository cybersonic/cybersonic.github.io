Sometimes you have projects that have hundreds of folders and files, its difficult to know which index.cfm you are editing and under which folder it is, especially if you are like me and hardly ever close files (I have been known to have 100+ files open at once).

If you want the Navigator to "follow" you, by selecting the file that you are currently editing, all you have to do is click on the "Link with Editor" button on the Navigator toolbar. 

This hint was actually suggested in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-users?hl=en ">cfeclipse users group</a> by David Herman. See, it pays off to join these groups!
