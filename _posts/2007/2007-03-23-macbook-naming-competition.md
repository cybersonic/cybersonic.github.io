Next week I shall (Hopefully!) be receiving my new black MacBook. This laptop has the following specs as its designed as a presentation laptop rather than a main production machine:

<ul>
 <li>2.00GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
<li>1GB 667 DDR2 SDRAM-2x512 (not a lot of Parallels actions going on with this machine I guess)
<li>120GB Serial ATA @ 5400 rpm (Fat presentations man, fat presentations)
<li>Superdrive 6x (To read those CD's and DVD's they give out at conferences)
<li>No Modem (Who uses a modem nowadays? At a pinch its bluetooth and my mobile!)
<li>iWorks '06-Z (for the presentations! I have to justify it somehow)
<li>Apple Mini-DVI to VGA Adapter (Can you believe I had to buy this as an extra??)
</ul>

Now, here comes the competition, well, kind of. There is no prize really, but I need to name this machine, and I have clean run out of ideas. I had some like "CFE_ONE" or "MR_Presento" but still, nothing good comes to mind. 

My MacBook Pro is actually named HAL after the computer in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>, which as you can tell isn't very imaginative hence my call for ideas!

(This little puppy will be travelling to all the conferences this summer and showing you all the top secret projects so you will get to see the computer name in case you win!)
