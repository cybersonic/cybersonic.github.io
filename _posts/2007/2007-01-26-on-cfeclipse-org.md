Apart from releasing a new version of the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">CFEclipse</a> ColdFusion plugin for <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, we have also been working on the brand new <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">site</a>. 


I want to thank <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm">Andy Allan</a> for the design, copy and basically moral support doing this. It has been hectic this week getting everything ready, along with the "Coldfusing Game" and banners, there has been some last minute changes to the plugin itself to make it work with Eclipse 3.1 as well as Eclipse 3.2, the addition of new icons designed by <a href="http://www.designuk.com/index.cfm?channel=1038">Chris Hoper</a> from <a href="http://www.designuk.com/">Design UK</a> as well as testing like a maniac (ok, I always test like a maniac, that is what users are like!).

The new website looks a bit bare even compared to the previous website, over the next week or so we shall be adding a *LOT* of new content and features that will hopefully help and inform you.

Please bear with us, as we get it all ready and, since "Under Construction" is a bit last century, treat the new site as "Beta" :)
