As you may know from my previous posts, I am a bit into <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" title="The Model-Glue Framework">Model-Glue</a>. Besides giving tips on using it I have talked at a couple of ColdFusion User Groups about the framework and try and pass on any knowledge I can, since I think its a nice brief framework that in conjunction with <a href="http://www.coldspringframework.org/" title="ColdSpring Framework: Welcome">ColdSpring</a> and <a href="http://www.reactorframework.org/" title="Reactor Framework - Trac">Reactor</a> (or <a href="http://transfer.riaforge.org/" title="Transfer ORM">Transfer</a>) can really help your application development.

The problem with just giving tips, is that if you have a whole development team to get up to speed, you need more formal training to really get up to speed. 

If you are in the USA, I found out recently that <a href="http://www.alagad.com/" title="Alagad: Enterprise ColdFusion and Flex Consulting, Training and Products">Alagad,Inc</a> that Ã¼ber development company (run by Reactor supremo <a href="http://www.alagad.com/go/blog?createdBy=dhughes" title="Alagad: The Alagad Technical Team Blog">Doug Hughes</a>, with none other than <a href="http://www.alagad.com/go/blog?createdBy=jrypkahauer" title="Alagad: The Alagad Technical Team Blog">Jared Rypka-Hauer</a> and <a href="http://www.alagad.com/go/blog?createdBy=sstroz" title="Alagad: The Alagad Technical Team Blog">Scott Stroz</a> amongst others!) has started offering training courses in Model-Glue!

The four day course based in Arlington VA seems to cover anything you need to get your team up to date, and, for a hands-on four day course doesn't seem expensive at all (ok, that might be because the pound is strong against the dollar, but then again, its still pretty cheap).

Check out the details on <a href="http://www.alagad.com/go/training/enterprise-coldfusion/enterprise-coldfusion-with-model-glue" title="Alagad: Enterprise ColdFusion with Model-Glue">Alagad's site</a>
