The CFEclipse project was pretty much the highest rated plugin at <a href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com">http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com</a> a while back, but it's taken a knock, we haven't publicised
it and I finally managed to get the entry updated.

So I am asking people to give it a vote (it managed to appear at the front of the Eclipse website over the weekend, just because its new) but it would be great if it had a bit better rating than the 8.9 (out of 10!) it currently has.
