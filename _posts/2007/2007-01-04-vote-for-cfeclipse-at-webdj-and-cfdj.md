There is a vote going on over at CFDJ for various web categories including <a href="http://www2.sys-con.com/mx/readerschoice2004/frameliveupdate.cfm?BType=3">Best Web Development Tool</a>. I just saw that Dreamweaver is beating CFEclipse? WHAT? We cant put up with that can we? So go over there and be honest and Vote for the best Web Development Tool!

Of course, there are other products there that we are competing against, strangely enough, ColdFusion 7.0.2, FusionDebug, NetAdvantage(??) and FusionReactor... Some of which should really be web applications surely? (not to take anything away from the Integral guys!!!)

So, go vote for what you think is right (*cough*CFEclipse*cough*)
