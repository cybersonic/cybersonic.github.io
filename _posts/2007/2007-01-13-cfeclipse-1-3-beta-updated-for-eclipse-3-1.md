A few people messaged me to let me know that the latest beta doesn't work on Eclipse 3.1.2 (Three point one point two, I keep getting blind-sided since I am mainly working with Eclipse 3.2.1 Three point TWO point one). I have put up a new build whilst I try and get ALL the features working on the beta later tonight.

If you are using Eclipse 3.1.2 you can now use the beta update site at http://www.cfeclipse.org/betaupdate and select the <em>CFEclipse 1.3 Beta RC2 (for Eclipse 3.1) 1.2.9.7</em> version. The only difference (apart that it works on that version of Eclipse) is that it doesn't have the CFUnit features I have mentioned. I shall try and get these working and then it will go back to a unified build.

Let me know if you have any problems.
