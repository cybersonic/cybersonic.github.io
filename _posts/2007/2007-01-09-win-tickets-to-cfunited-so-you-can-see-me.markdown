Ok, you might have *other* reasons for going to <a href="http://www.cfunited.com/2007/">CFUnited</a> this year apart from wanting to hear me talk about <a href="http://cfunited.com/2007/pages/topics.cfm#track-advancedcf">Advanced CFEclipse</a>, although I cannot imagine them (joking!).

If you want a free (yes siree, FREE as in nada, nothing, zero, zip) ticket to CFUnited you have to listen to the most excellent <a href="http://cfunited.com/2007/pages/topics.cfm#track-advancedcf">ColdFusion Weekly</a> podcast, which I presume you are already doing for goodness sakes! There is NO excuse not to! At the end of every episode from now to May they will be giving a valid entry code. Use your iTunes for something actually interesting and get listening!

Note: You could be saving up to $849!!! You can spend it on buying me drinks!!!
