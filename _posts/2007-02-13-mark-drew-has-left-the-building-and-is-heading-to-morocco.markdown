I am heading off to Marrakech tomorrow for a few days holiday with my significant other. She has suffered enough with my constant coding and I think its time I took her somewhere nice. So for Valentine's we are heading to Morocco for a few days.

I shall be away from any kind of technology (I might take my mobile phone but just for photos) which will be a well deserved break both from my day job and from <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>, since I have been working since 6am every day doing both jobs.

As an aside, I am very excited (aside from the fantastic holiday ahead!) as I am getting another project ready for <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/conference/">cfObjective</a>. I think this project (lets call it Project Unity for the moment) will really knock people's socks off at the conference. I DID promise I would show a new unseen feature at every CF conference this year didn't I?

See you all back next monday!
