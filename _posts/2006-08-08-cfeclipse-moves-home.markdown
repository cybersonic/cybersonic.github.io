Well, not completely, we have moved away from the CVS repository that was hosted at <a href="http://cfeclipse.tigris.org">cfeclipse.tigris.org</a> and onto SVN. <a href="http://www.simb.net/client/index.cfm/2006/8/4/Community-Project-Sites-Updated">Simeon Bateman</a> has done an awesome job of setting up the new <a href="http://svn.cfeclipse.org/">SVN repository</a> and <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/trac.cgi">Trac system</a>, so a big round of applause for him!

We are still in the process of moving all the bugs and issues to trac from the tigris site, and once that is done, we shall see about closing off the issues there so people dont post their bugs to the wrong site!

As in the previous posts I started mentioning the grouping of features into named modules and hopefully Trac will help us manage milestones and releases a bit better so we can plan or at least see the progress on each phase.

I have also been playing around with an exciting new feature for CFEclipse... but more work needs to be done on it before I release the details.
