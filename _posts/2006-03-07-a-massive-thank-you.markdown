I wanted to say a massive (public) thank you to Michael White for sending me Dune (the TV Series) from my Amazon wish list for all my work on CFEclipse.<br /><br />It is the first thing I have actually got so I am really chuffed. Makes all the late nights and worries worth it!<br /><br />I need to compile the recording I did of the CFUG and put that online. I shall be doing that sometime this week.
