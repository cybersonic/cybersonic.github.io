As I am sure anyone that has gone to one of my CFEclipse presentations would know, I also happen to be to co-manager of the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/">UK CFUG</a>

Over the coming months, I want to fill up a schedule of speakers, myself included  on a variety of topics, and I would really welcome suggestions from the community, especially those in the UK (and more so those that are able to attend our London based CFUG meetins) for topics that you would like to hear more about.

I can do most of these presentations (well, depending what they are of course!) and also very much welcome other speakers. 

So, if you have a suggestion, let me know!
