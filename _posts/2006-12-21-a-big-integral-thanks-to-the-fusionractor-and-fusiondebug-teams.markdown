I know my recent posts have all been thanks for the donations to repair my laptop, but I got an email today from the guys at Integral, more commonly know as the developers of <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/index.html">FusionDebug</a> and <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/home.html">FusionReactor</a>.

They emailed me to let me know that they had got me a few items (very important ones if you develop Eclipse plugins) from my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/622WQR01XXWO">Amazon Wish-List</a>, namely:

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eclipse-Modeling-Framework-Frank-Budinsky/dp/0131425420/sr=8-1/qid=1166716100/ref=sr_1_1/202-5218834-0604624?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Eclipse Modeling Framework</a>: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/">EMF</a> is about how to develop model driven plugins, which will (when I read it) allow us to do some crazy stuff with re-factoring and UML generation (when tied into <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmf">GMF</a>) 

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Head-First-Object-oriented-Analysis-Design/dp/0596008678/sr=11-1/qid=1166716243/ref=sr_11_1/202-5218834-0604624">Head First Object-oriented Analysis and Design</a>: Since I am developing some CF frameworks in my day to day life as well as doing CFEclipse, I thought I would brush up again on the fundamentals. I have the Head First Design Patterns book and that is amazing. This book was recommended by <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/12/8/Head-First-has-done-it-again">Peter Bell</a>, a guy that does know his noodles!

The last book was: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-JFace-Experts-Voice/dp/1590593251/sr=11-1/qid=1166716375/ref=sr_11_1/202-5218834-0604624">The Definitive Guide to SWT and JFace</a>: Now, I am fairly competent with Java, but the GUI stuff is just infuriating. No, really. I NEEDED this book to do any of the interfaces. Eclipse has some handy classes and shortcuts for this but if you want anything out of the box, I am usually left stranded and googling. This will hopefully bring some nicer looks to CFEclipse in the coming year.

THANK YOU GUYS! 

I really should mention (I am sure I was going to do a blog post about this a while back, probably got side tracked) that FusionReactor has saved my bacon a number of times over the last few months and has recently been nominated for a<a href="http://www2.sys-con.com/mx/readerschoice2004/frameliveupdate.cfm?BType=2"> CFDJ Most Innovative Application</a> award, and richly deserved too!

Also, if you haven't heard about it (where have you been???) FusionDebug is the must have plugin for Eclipse (even if you don't use CFEclipse*) and has also been nominated by CFDJ as <a href="http://www2.sys-con.com/mx/readerschoice2004/frameliveupdate.cfm?BType=3">Best Web Development Tool</a>. I know this sounds like advertising but really, get these tools, I cannot recommend them enough as part of your toolkit. If you are running any sort of CF server you will thank me (well, thank them really!)

A quick update, FusionDebug 1.5 is coming in January, you can sign up for the beta over at the <a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fusiondebug/openBetaSignup.html">FusionDebug</a> website!

*What do you mean you dont use CFEclipse? You want me to come round there and set it up for you PERSONALLY? sheesh! Should I code it for you too? :)
