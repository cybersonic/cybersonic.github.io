Did you know you can suggest topics for this years <a href="http://www.adobemax2007.com/topics/information/">Adobe Max</a>?

I don't know about you, but I think the people's <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">favourite free IDE for ColdFusion</a> should be there, don't you think?

Not saying anything but *hint* *hint*, Barcelona isn't that far from London, and I think I might know someone that knows a  bit about CFEclipse that could go and talk.

Up to you really, but you could go and suggest a topic. Now, what comes to mind eh?

Did I also mention, that at each conference, I shall be unveiling a MAJOR new feature of the product? I am sure I did.  So the first feature, called Project:U will be......announced at <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com">cfObjective</a>! See you there!
