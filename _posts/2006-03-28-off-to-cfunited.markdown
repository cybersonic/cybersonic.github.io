<a href="http://www.cfunited.com/" target="_blank"><img width="228" height="52" border="0" align="left" src="/UserFiles/Image/header_01.gif" alt="" /></a>Finally, all sorted, I am off to CFUnited on the 27th of June. I have the flights booked, the hotel in Washington DC (well Rockville) booked and my tickets all sorted out. I cant wait! I shall also be taking this opportunity to have myself a little holiday in San Francisco too, so after the conference we are flying out to San Francisco for a week (just in time for the 4th of July). <br /><br />We are staying at the Ramada Inn, not sure if it is miles away from the conference but at least we got a room to suit our special dietary requirements, mainly that my partner and I are both rabid smokers...&nbsp; (the flights are going to be interesting... white knuckle rides I am sure!)<br /><br />Now if anybody has some groovy ideas for things to do in Washington (ok ok.. Rockville?) and/or San Francisco... please let me know!<br />
