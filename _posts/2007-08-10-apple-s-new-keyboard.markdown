<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markdrew/1071674246/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/1071674246_1d8f525156_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="New Apple Keyboard" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"/></a> As today is a nice sunny day, I thought I would take a bit of a walk over to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/retail/">Apple Store on Regent Street</a> and get myself one of those fancy <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=F032B6D0&nplm=MB110B/A">new Apple keyboards</a>. The reason behind this (apart from that I could and it was a nice day for a walk) was that I was attracted to a laptop style keyboard on my main work iMac. 

So, what do I think of it so far? I love it. Apart from all the funky keys you have on it (which I have so far to setup) it is more importantly very quiet! 

Another nice thing about it is its responsiveness, its pretty fast and feels immediate. 

It is of course difficult to describe a keyboard since you have to do it by feel, but so far I am loving this! 

The only test I now have to put it to is the Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory test! Maybe a bit later on tonight, and more info shall be posted!
