If you are planning to come to my CFEclipse:Reloaded presentation at CFUnited on Saturday morning, I have good news for you, I have moved it to the afternoon, basically swapped it with Sandy Clark. 

This means that you can get a lie in in the morning! 

So to re-iterate, I shall be presenting at 4pm in room 152B on Saturday, rather than 9:45 am. (Before that I shall be presenting ColdSpring: better living through configuration in the same room from 2:45)
