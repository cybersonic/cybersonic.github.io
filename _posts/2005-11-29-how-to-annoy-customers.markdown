So, I took the plunge and decided to get cable tv. I know, I know.. I should already be hooked into this but hell, I watch movies mainly rather than mainstream TV but I thought, I am going to have a few weeks off and it will be nice to have some good TV to watch (ok, debatable) but also the fact that I get terrible reception through the aerial, so much so that most of the time I think I am drunk.

So, I asked NTL to come round and install the cable box. I already have broadband with them so it shouldnt be too difficult since basically I just need the damn box. 

They were booked in from 12 till 6 today. So I took the day off... to wait. And wait. And wait.

So its 7pm now and they have gone awol. Got a few calls from NTL saying that they are on their way. Then told that they had been round earlier in the day (I think NOT!)  

What  a waste of a day! At least it gave me a chance to work on my little ajax store, that little by little I am getting it to work.  (you can see it <a href="/ajaxstore/">here</a>

Dont use NTL.
