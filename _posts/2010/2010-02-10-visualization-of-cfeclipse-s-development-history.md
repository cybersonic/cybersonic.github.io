<p>I have created a video using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/">code_swarm</a> to show the history of CFEclipse's development history, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! I am using this for other projects as a beautiful as well as useful way to see how a project progresses over time:</p>
<p>Edit: Since we moved CFEclipse from tigris.org back in 2006 I missed out the main people that worked on the Project such as <a href="http://robrohan.com/">Rob Rohan</a>, <a href="http://www.yellowbadger.com/">Spike Milligan</a> and Oliver Tupman (to mention a few!). </p>
