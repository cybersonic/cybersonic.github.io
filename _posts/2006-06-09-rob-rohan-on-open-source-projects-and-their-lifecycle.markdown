Rob started the CFEclipse project a while back and he has done  an awesome job. He has since left the CFEclipse project but I still tap him for info and a chat nearly every day and apart from coming up with good ideas he is a pretty dammed cool guy.

He has written a post about <a href="http://weblog.robrohan.com/5A-notes/703905/880156/">Open Source Life Cycle, Slight Rant</a> which really has just echoed my feelings over the last few days.

There have been a number of threads (well, <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/cf_lists/messages.cfm/forumid:4/threadid:46188">one in particular</a>) over in the cf-talk mailing list that actually got my blood up a little. 

Before people start asking for features for CFEclipse or bemoaning it doesnt do something they want it to do or does something different, I beg of you to read this post.
