I just wanted to say a big thanks to <a href="http://inner-rhythm.co.uk/blog/">Big Mad Kev</a> for donating to CFEclipse, and currently the status is ??65 towards the ??350 (less actually but its a round number) that I need to get to fix my laptop's keyboard.

I cant thank the fella enough, apart from buying me that "one too many" Jack Daniel's at <a href="http://cfdevcon.com/">CFDevCon</a> is is a wicked fella with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markdrew/293646325/">cheekiest</a> smile :)
