I have noticed recently that a number of blogs seem to be getting spammed.

Now, why is this different from normal? Well, it seems to me that this spam is *human* spam, rather than bots or anything. They seem to be getting past the captcha on blog comments. The volume is fairly low for a bot, but its constant.

I just wondered if it was just because most of the blogs that I read are running blogCFC, there are human spammers, or there is some way round the captcha?

Just so you know, I have started moderating comments for this reason, don't worry, I shall be checking my email to make sure  that the right comments are displayed. 

Oh, and most of the IP's seem to be from China. Whatever gets you through the day guys, your spam posts wont appear here.
