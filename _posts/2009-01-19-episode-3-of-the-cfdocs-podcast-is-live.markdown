In a record breaking time, I managed to edit the latest episode of the CFDocs podcast for the UKCFUG. This time with a new "refreshing" intro tune and as per listener requests, I have shortened the intro (I mean sheesh! Was 30 seconds TOO long?)
</p>

<p>
I am looking at getting a couple of microphones for the next recording, but the problem is doing multi-track recording and getting it all setup. Some listeners (and in fact <a href="http://www.brianmeloche.com/blog/index.cfm/CFConversations" title="CF_Heavy: CFConversations">Brian Meloche</a> from the <a href="http://www.cfconversations.com/" title="CFConversations - an Adobe ColdFusion and CFML podcast">CFConversations</a> podcast) have recommended the <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/products/snowball" title="Blue Microphones: Products: Snowball">Blue Snowball</a> but alas, it is not available in the UK yet. So I might have to see about some other nice microphones, of course, any suggestions are warmly welcome!
</p>
<p>
My current workflow is as follows, we record on multiple laptops using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" title="Audacity: Free Audio Editor and Recorder">Audacity</a>, I then get those recordings and merge them into one recording and edit out all the bits, do some enveloping and trimming and then export an uncompressed file that I can use in Garageband. I then split the podcast track adding whatever images are required and URLs and export that.

<p>
The next part which I might change, depending on costs, is to upload it to <a href="http://www.libsyn.com/" title="libsyn // podcasting made easy">Libsyn</a>, which allows for FTP uploading and you can then put the title and description etc, and it will then publish an RSS feed and publish it ready for iTunes to publish out.

<br>
Although I have been using <a href="http://www.libsyn.com/" title="libsyn // podcasting made easy">Linsyn</a> for a while and it's pretty cheap at $5 a month for 100Mb fast access storage, I am thinking I might move all of the stuff over to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)">Amazon S3</a> and use a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)">Railo Amazon EC2</a> image to publish it out, so I shall let you know how that goes!
