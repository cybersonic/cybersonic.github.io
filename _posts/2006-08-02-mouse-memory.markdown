I was just talking with <a href="http://www.edomgroup.com/blog">Mike Kelp</a> about some stuff, and somehow we come up with an idea, or rather a question. I need a new USB drive (to hand out <a href-"http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> to passing strangers, that sort of thing) and I was thinking, why dont USB mice have built in USB drives? why would I need to plug two things into my computer, since I dont think a USB drive would mind being moved about and clicked on much.

Anyone spot one, let me know... before I get the bluetooth <a href="http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/">Mighty Mouse</a> (if it works under windows of course). The most amazing (to me at any rate) is that the Mighty Mouse works on one OR two batteries... how cool is that?
