I forgot to mention, but when I got home from my travels yesterday I had a couple of parcels from amazon waiting for me.

<a href="http://edomgroup.com/blog/">Mike Kelp</a> sent me a couple of items from my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/622WQR01XXWO">wish list</a>: 
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00004VVQT/026-3281418-5982001?v=glance&n=283926">Rainbow Bridge DVD</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1416516972/026-3281418-5982001?v=glance&n=266239">Aeon Flux: The Herodotus Files</a>

Apart from it being really awesome of him to send me those items, I got them on my birthday! So now, apart from my JD Zippo lighter and my new PSP with Lemmings, I have those items as well! I am indeed a lucky old developer!

I have to say that Mike has been helping out on the CFEclipse project and I know he will be making some really valuable contributions to the project in the near future... so if anyone is using <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> near Dallas, TX and going to the CFUG, definately buy the man a beer on my behalf!
