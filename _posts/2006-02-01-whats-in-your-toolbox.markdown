<p>I have been using <a href="http://www.mattkruse.com/javascript/">Mark Kruse's Javascript toolbox</a> site for a while to download those Javascript functions that you just need NOW! I spotted that he has finally moved his scripts to its own site! <a href="http://www.javascripttoolbox.com/">Javascript Toolbox</a> is a great site full of easy to implement functions such as a DHTML tree, all the select box functions you would need (sorting, moving, multiple selects etc).
He also has started <a href="http://www.ajaxtoolbox.com/">http://www.ajaxtoolbox.com/</a> with some great libraries!
Just what the JS doctor ordered!</p>
