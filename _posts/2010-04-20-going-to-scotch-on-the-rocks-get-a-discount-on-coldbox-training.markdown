<p>If you are heading to London on the 24th and 25th of May for the awesome <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/">Scotch on the Rocks conference</a> you might also want to know that for the rest of the week there will be a post conference training in the <a href="http://coldbox.org/">Coldbox Framework</a>. <br /><br />Not only is <a href="http://coldbox.org/">ColdBox </a>an awesome framework, but the training will be done by the framework's author, Luis Majano! This is a great opportunity to get up to speed and even become an expert on the framework (I have seen Luis train and this really is a fantastic opportunity!)<br /><br />Not only can you sign up for this training, but after a bit of arm twisting and smooth talking, I have managed to get an awesome discount for you to sign up for this class. Just follow the following link to get your discount! <a href="http://coldbox-uk.eventbrite.com/?discount=mdUKLives">http://coldbox-uk.eventbrite.com/?discount=mdUKLives</a><br /><br />No, no need to thank me, just sign up and expand your framework knowledge! </p>
