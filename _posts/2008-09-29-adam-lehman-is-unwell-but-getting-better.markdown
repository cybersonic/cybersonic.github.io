<p>On Friday night, Adam had an accident and broke is arm and leg as he was hit by a car in Regent Street, London. I accompanied him to the hospital in the ambulance that night and got it all sorted. It was simply an accident and even though the driver was just under the alcohol limit, the police are not taking action (as far as I know).</p>
<p>He is currently in a hospital in London where he has already had surgery on his leg and will be having surgery on his arm (maybe) later today. Hopefully he will be out in a week or two.</p>
<p>Even through this, he has managed to Â <a href="http://twitter.com/adrocknaphobia">Twitter</a> and update his status. So he is doing OK, if a little out of it due to the pain killers.</p>
<p>I am sure we all are sending him our support.</p>
