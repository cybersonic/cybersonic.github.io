Welcome back after the bank holiday (if you had one!) I thought I would post a few handy shortcuts for CFEclipse. If you have any others that you want to send me, please do so.

<strong>Working with Files</strong>
Ctrl + E = List open files, then start typing the name and it should limit it to the ones you want
Ctrl + Shift + R = Find a file in the project (in CFEclipse this shortcut needs to be used from the Navigator window)
Ctrl+F6 = Tab back through open files
Ctrl + Shift + F6 = Tab forwards through open files
Ctrl+M = Maximise/Minimse Current window

<strong>Editing in CFEclipse</strong>
<snippet>Ctrl + i = insert the snippet defined by the trigger text

<strong>We have you surrounded</strong>
Here are a few shortcuts to surround the selected but of code with whatever you need
Ctrl+F3 = Surround with ##
</snippet>Ctrl+' = Surround with '
Ctrl+Shift+' = Surround with "
Ctrl+Shift+O = Surround with <cfoutput></cfoutput>
Ctrl+Shift+D = Surround with a good <cfdump var="">
Ctrl+Shift+R = Surround with <cfscript>

<b>No, Comments!
</b>You can also add comments very quicky with these shortcuts:
Ctrl+Shift+M = Surround with CF comments <!--- --->
Ctrl+Shift+C =  Surround with the apropiate <!-- --> or <!--- ---> comments depending what type of code you are surrounding, neat huh?


<snippet><b>HELP!
</b>The trusty F1 will send you to<a href="http://www.cfdocs.org/"> http://www.cfdocs.org</a> and redirect you to the right page.
