An MSN site that I have been a member of since we decided to move to Spain has finally disappeared in mysterious circumstances, this is the second MSN group that seems to have been cut short in its life. 

I am still trying to get to the bottom of it but I wonder if other groups are suffering the same fate and if Microsoft is planning a complete removal of these features in MSN or simply starting to charge for them!

*Update! <a href="http://news.com.com/Hotmail+incinerates+customer+files/2100-1038_3-5226090.html ">Hotmail is loosing people's files</a>. could this be the culprit?
