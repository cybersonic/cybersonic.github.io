<a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> Is a product from the tastily named Delicious Monster. It allows you to scan the barcodes of your DVDs, CDs, books and games to add them to a library. You can then feel free to lend them out to your friends and know that you can chase the thieveing rascals up when they dont fess up with the goods in time.

Its an OS X app so if you are Windows Only Square (WOS), maybe you could look for an emulator like <a href="http://pearpc.sourceforge.net/">PearPC</a> and give it a whirl. It says it needs <a href="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight</a> to work (Aople's Webcam). As yet I havent managed to get it running on my lowly iBook, as I still havent upgraded to Panther but I shall let you know.
