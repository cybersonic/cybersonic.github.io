I was talking to Teddy Payne today, and he mentioned he was off to a ColdFusion lunch. And I thought, why dont we set some of those up round London (I know, sorry guys if you are not in London). You know... something like we meet once a month and discuss shop, or do 1/2 presentations or topics?

What do you think about this? (that is presuming you are in London or can make it to London easily enough?)

Comments/suggestions always welcome!
