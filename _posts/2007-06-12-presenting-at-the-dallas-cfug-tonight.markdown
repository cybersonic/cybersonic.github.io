Oh yes J.R. I shall be donning my best shoulder pads tonight and trying not to get shot (or was it a dream sequence?) and will be presenting for the Dallas/Fort Worth CFUG tonight. It will be a late one for me (about 1am BST) but will be worth it. 

I shall be going over what CFEclipse is, installation and things you can get done with it as well as some of the new features.

If you care to join, you can hook up via <a href="http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/dfwcfugcfeclipse/">Adobe Connect</a> and join the fun!

Hopefully the connection will be better and that <a href="http://dfwcfug.instantspot.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/6/1/Next-meeting--June-12-2007--Mark-Drew-on-CFEclipse">Dave </a> manages to record it!
