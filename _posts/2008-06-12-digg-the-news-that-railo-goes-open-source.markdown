I have just posted the news to Digg that <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Railo_joins_JBoss_ColdFusion_alternative_goes_open_source">Railo is going Open Source</a>. I am surprised that this wasn't dugg before! 

So that we can get more exposure for both CFML and that Railo goes open source, I urge (nay! Plead!) that you <a href="http://digg.com/programming/Railo_joins_JBoss_ColdFusion_alternative_goes_open_source">Digg this article</a>!

Exciting times ahead!
