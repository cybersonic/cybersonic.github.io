During the <a href="http://cfunited.com" title="CFUnited: The Premiere ColdFusion Conference">CFUnited 2008 Conference</a> in DC, most speakers were able to record their presentations onto Adobe Connect. This is a great feature for most presentation styles (of course not all, since you might want to have a discussion, rather than a presentation), rather than just filming the speaker.

Here are the Adobe Connect presentations that have been posted so far:
	
	<ul>
		<li>CFEclipse reloaded: <a href="http://partners.adobe.acrobat.com/p69604765/">http://partners.adobe.acrobat.com/p69604765/</a></li>
		<li>Coldspring: Better living through configuration <a href="http://partners.adobe.acrobat.com/p37989763/">http://partners.adobe.acrobat.com/p37989763/</a></li>
