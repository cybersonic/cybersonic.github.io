I know I talk a lot about Coldfusion  and <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">CFEclipse </a>etc, but one of the frameworks that I havent been exposed to has been Mach II. Not a great bane of my life or anything but I simply havent been exposed to it to really know whats "good" about it and what it gives me as a developer.

<a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=946A7358-06CE-3A64-2BCEEC389D12CE52">Sean Corfield</a> put a recent entry in his <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/index.cfm">Architect's View blog</a> about <a href="http://tutorial345.easycfm.com/">this </a>tutorial, which even if its a part one does give a good insight into getting started with the <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/">Mach II</a> framework.

This is interesting particularly to me since I contribute to the CFEclipse project and have my own<a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/"> Fusebox plugin</a> for CFEclipse. One of the things that astounded me was that as I had started developing the plugin for Fusebox 3 was how easlity I could include support for Fusebox 4 since it was basically parsing and XML document.

One of the thoughts, if no one else is doing it is to also add Mach II support. But first, I have to get my head round Mach II! So<a href="http://tutorial345.easycfm.com"> this tutorial</a> is a great starter for 10
