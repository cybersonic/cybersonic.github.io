Rob Rohan put a post a couple of days ago that I forgot to mention. He has been "porting" <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc/">blogCFC</a> to <a href="http://www.model-glue.com/">ModelGlue:Unity</a> which is an awesome thing as you could then add a blog to your main MG site as an Action Pack!

The more interesting part is that he has been <a href="http://thoth.robrohan.com/projects/BlogCFCAtom/">integrating the Atom Protocol</a> into blogCFC so you can use external clients to manage your posts. Clever guy that Rob!

You can read more about this over at his <a href="http://thoth.robrohan.com/client/index.cfm/2006/8/3/BlogCFCUnity">blog</a>
