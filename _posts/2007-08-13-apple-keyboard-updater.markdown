I am not sure if anybody out there has bought the new apple keyboard, but it has some new features and has changed the location of a number of keys. 

The problem here is that they don't match with the previous keyboards and the keyboard itself comes with no software, but to make use of the features of the keyboard (mainly the function buttons) you can download a <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/keyboardsoftwareupdate11.html">Keyboard Software Update 1.1</a> from Apple's site.

More info to come once I install it!

UPDATE: If you run software update, it is actually there waiting for me, and a smaller download than from the site.

UPDATE: After the updater, all the shortcut keys (sound, brightness, dashboard etc) seem to be the right ones as per the keyboard. Woohoo!
