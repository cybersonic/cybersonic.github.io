Just updated on the <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/blog/" title="Scotch on the Rocks Blog">SOTR Blog</a> is the ticket pricing for next year's conference.

It seems that it is an intelligent pricing model, which apart from the early bird at Â£199 + VAT till end of Feb, also has the idea of a Company Flexi Pass, which means that a different person from the same company can attend the conference on different days, very handy to spread the knowledge to your team without loosing the productivity for the whole conference.
