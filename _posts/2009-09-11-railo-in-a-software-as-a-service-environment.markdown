<p>Straker, the makers of ShadoCMS and Zoom Flex have put up a great blog posting regarding using Railo in a Software as a Service environment.</p>
<p>They cover four areas such as Scalability, Security, Cost and Updates and even though it shows the <a href="http://www.getrailo.org/index.cfm/download/">Railo Server</a> as a winner it is a overally fairly balanced article from the point of view of their requirements</p>
<p>Check out the full blog post on the <a href="http://www.shadocms.com/shadozoom/company/blog/2009/why-railo-kicks-butt-for-coldfusion-based-saas.cfm">Straker Blog</a></p>
