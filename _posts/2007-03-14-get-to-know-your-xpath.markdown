Working with XML in ColdFusion can be fun or can be daunting sometimes. One of the things that is a gotcha for me all the time is doing XPath, even after a few minutes of googling for "Xpath Tutorial" or whatever I get bored, find the solution and then that's it.

One of the great little tools I found upon my travels is the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xpe/">XPath Explorer</a>, its a nice little jar file that you can just double click and run (if you are on a Mac, God help you if you are on a PC, Windows will proably think its a banana or a Nokia package installer). Once you have it running you can load in an XML File and start creating XPaths either by entering the text or clicking on nodes.

It also comes as plugins for Eclipse and NetBeans

Very handy!
