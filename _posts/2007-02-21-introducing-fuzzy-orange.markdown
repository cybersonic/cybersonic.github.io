A strange title indeed, but Fuzzy Orange is a new consultancy company headed by <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk">Andy Allan</a> providing Coldfusion consultancy, training and hosting solutions (amongst some of the <A href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/2/20/Fuzzy-Orange-Ltd---Consultancy">services</a>!)

There seems to be a trend with the geniuses from the CF world to head out on their own consultancies recently (see <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/">Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.firemoss.com/">Joe</a> and <a href="http://www.carehart.org/">Charlie</a> for example) and I think Andy will do great! So if you have any CF needs get in touch with him!

Dont expect me to do the same anytime soon, CFEclipse as yet doesn't pay the Jack Daniel's bills yet!
