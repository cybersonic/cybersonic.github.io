Robert Blackburn has been writing some excellent articles on using CFEclipse over at <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com">Fusion Authority</a>, this week he is covering <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/Reviews/4631-CFEclipse-Features-Code-Folding.htm">Code Folding</a>. A great little article to get you going and folding that code!
