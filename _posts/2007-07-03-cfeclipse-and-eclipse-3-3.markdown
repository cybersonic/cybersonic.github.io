At <a href="http://cfunited.com/">CFUnited 2007</a>, I did a couple of presentations showing <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/">CFEclipse</a>, which at the end of the presentation I mentioned was actually running on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/europa/">Eclipse 3.3</a>. Not bad going considering that Eclipse 3.3 was released on the day of my first presentation huh?

The issue now is getting everything REALLY working, I did a number of smoke tests and even did a whole presentation running Eclipse 3.3 but there are some things I want to tidy and other changes I want to make before I do a release (just doing a compatibility release seems a waste of time at the moment, considering the effort involved!)

So, what and when should you expect? Well, I am going to be checking in stuff this week, I only do checkins against an issue so I have to create the right ones (if they are not there). You should see more activity over at the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/timeline">CFEclipse Trac</a> website. Also, if you are planning on adding a ticket to Trac, make sure there isnt one there already, I have spotted a few been adding about Eclipse 3.3 already, there is no need to add more!

I want to send out a big thank you to <a href="http://www.cfreport.org/">Dean Harmon</a> as he did all the Eclipse 3.3 compatibility including the backwards compatibility stuff. Now, stop saying that Adobe does nothing to contribute!!!

So, there it is, a semi-official announcement... saying not much... but at least now you know.
