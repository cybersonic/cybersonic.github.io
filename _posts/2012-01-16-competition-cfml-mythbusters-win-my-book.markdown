<img src="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/enclosures/mythbusters_busted..png" width="100" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">
<p>I shall be presenting the topic "CFML Mythbusters" at a couple of conferences this year so far (<a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" title="cf.Objective() 2012: The Only Enterprise ColdFusion Conference... - cf.Objective()">cf.Objective</a> and <a href="http://opencfsummit.org/" title="Home - OpenCF Summit">OpenCF Summit</a>)! 
<br>	
So that you just don't have to hear about my chosen "myths" I thought I would open it up as a competition to all the readers of my blog! </p>

<p>
	I shall be answering a lot of questions already, but would like to get some reader suggestions, for example, here are just some of the few I have (sent in by some very honorable people I have to say!):
	
	<ul>
		<li>“CFScript is always faster! ?Even when using for loops!” - Alfred Einstein</li>
			<li>“Inline IF’s are much better than &lt;CFIF&gt;. I will stake my stake on it” - Abraham Van Helsing</li>
		<li>“Is isDefined() bad?” - Abe Simpson</li>
		<li>“&lt;cfoutput&gt;#Item#&lt;/cfoutput&gt; is the only way to go” - Mohandas Gandhi</li>
	</ul>
	
	to give you some ideas!
</p>
<p>
	Of course, it wouldn't be any kind of competition if you didn't win anything! So what's the prize I hear you ask?
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>First place gets a physical, signed copy of my book, <a href="bit.ly/RailoBook">Railo 3: Beginners Guide</a>, their question answered in the presentation (obiously) and my blog, the question dedicated to them and a big shout out when I cover their question EACH time I present it. WOW!</li>
		<li>Two second places also get their question answered in the presentation, another shout out, and an electronic version of <a href="bit.ly/RailoBook">Railo 3: Beginners Guide</a>
		</li>
		<li>The third place ALSO gets their question answered in the presentation and this blog, and a shout out</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	I shall be drawing the results at the end of January 2012 so get your thinking hats on and then <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDE5ZUpNeVZ1T21GbjFKU0s3MlJoaEE6MQ">submit your Myths to be Busted</a>!
</p>

<p>
EDIT: You can submit multiple suggestions!
