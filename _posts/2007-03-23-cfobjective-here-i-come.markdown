I have just booked my flight to cfObjective in May. I am both full of trepidation as this will be my first time speaking at a US conference but overly excited at unveiling the results of the top secret, Project:U. 

I am still working on this, and probably will be working on it non-stop till the eve of the conference but even in its current (broken? err.. feature incomplete?) state I still think it will cause quite a hit (hopefully not a hit of rotten tomatoes hitting me!) 


<span class="pullquote">Does anybody else get nervous when they spend ?379.31 ($744.889) on a flight</span> and check and re-check everything like 100 times?

This also brings me to hotel bookings, why is the world mad on Visa cards? I don't posses one and I am happy with that. It just makes me nervous to think that a foreign government (yes Mr Bush, I am looking at you) is allowed to get all my private details including being able to look into my bank accounts just when I visit their country! Illegal? I think so! (rant over, sorry, back to normal service)
