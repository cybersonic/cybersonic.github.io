I am making all these videos on CFEclipse available as a podcast, which you can subscribe to via iTunes -> Advanced -> Subscribe to Podcast -> and entering <a href="http://markdrew.libsyn.com/rss">http://markdrew.libsyn.com/rss</a>

You can also search for my podcast if you are using iTunes in the Music Store section and seaching for <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=152536611&s=143444">MD on CF</a> 

Hopefully the show notes include the blog postings. Enjoy!
