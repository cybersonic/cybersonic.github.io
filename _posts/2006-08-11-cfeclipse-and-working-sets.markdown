<a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/markdrew/EclipseScreenSnapz002.mov" target="_blank"><img src="/blog/enclosures/working_sets.png" align="left"></a>Jeff asks:

<blockquote>
<em>
Mark, I have many clients each with multiple projects.  Currently when I create projects in CFEclipse I name them with the client name as a prefix (abbreviated).  My project listing is now huge.  Is there a way to create a project group and then place the projects within said group?  And if so, can I move (or drag+drop) the current projects into said groups instead of having to recreate them all?  Thanks!

Jeff, the way round this is to create a working set. I have made a little video on how to achieve this (its easier to show than to describe) and I hope this helps (just click on the image to view it)

You basically have to create a Resource working set whilst you are in the CFEclipse perspective. Then you can switch between clients and see all their projects, its not so much of a drag and drop, but more of a tick-the-box aproach.

I hope this helps!
