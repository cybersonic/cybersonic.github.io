I am simply amazed, really. I woke up this morning, got my laptop (and keyboard and mouse) out and checked my email as I do every morning, and I was staggered. 

LOTS of donations come through last night, I dont know where to start to thank you all but the CF community has got together and managed to raise enough to get this little laptop fixed!

I shall be doing this in the new year (need to get a spare machine at work and my old Powerbook setup) and cant wait to  thank you all for helping me on this.

I am really humbled this morning... 

I want to say a big thank you to : Daniel Kim,  Steven Bryan , Andy Allan (he who just works too much!),Ryan Everhart,Jim Rutherford,  Peter Bell (keep blogging man!) and Brian Rinaldi.

You are all the most amazing people!
