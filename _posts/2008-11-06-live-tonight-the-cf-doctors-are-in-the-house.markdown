<p>At least live in this <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/post.cfm/ukcfug-is-back">month's UK Coldfusion User Group meeting</a>! <br /><br />The UKCFUG managers will be hosting the first live recording of the "CF Doc's" Podcast at tonight's meeting, the podcast covering some CF community news but mainly answering YOUR questions! Yes, we have had some great questions posted already that we shall be answering tonight.<br /><br />But fear not, you can also call in your questions via Skype! Just call the "UKCFUG" number or simply click the button below if you want your call featured in the show.<br /><br />Hopefully the recording will go well and become a monthly feature.</p>
