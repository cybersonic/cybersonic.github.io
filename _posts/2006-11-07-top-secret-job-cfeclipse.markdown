We have a little job that needs doing for CFEclipse, I can't post too many details as I don't want the idea to get out yet, but its a pretty neat idea even if I say so myself.

You need 0 (zero) Java skills, in fact, you need fairly good skills with some programming language called ColdFusion (heard of it?), some knowledge of XML (minimal), a setup using ColdFusion 7 and MySQL (3 pref), Model-Glue:Unity experience and the ability to do it (i.e. have the time to do it).

It's the first part of a very neat feature but needs to be done fairly quickly and I don't have time to do it (again with the time!) since I am presenting at <a href="http://www.cfdevcon.com">CFDevCon</a>!

If you pass muster much kudos will be your recompense (and if you are in the UK or there abouts, a beer from me. Honest!), so <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:znex\056qerj\100tznvy\056pbz?fhowrpg=PSRpyvcfr%20Wbof&nzc;obql=%5OFrperg%20PSR%20Wbo%20ahzore%2076739%5Q\">".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c)\{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
