This isnt a great job, the pay sucks (its non-existent) but you will get lots of kudos (not least from me!). If you would like to help the CFEclipse team, I have a job that needs doing, its pure CF. You wont even break a sweat, you might not even have to DO anything! How is that for an amazing job?

Ok, so you want the job description? I need an RSS aggregator built for the new CFEclipse.org site. I know I could do it... I have no time at the moment to do it. It will need to aggregate news from a list of blogs (we run on mysql if you are thinking of using a DB) and return posts that have the category of cfeclipse.

I would prefer if it was in Model-Glue: Unity or a CFC, since I shall be plugging this into the new site.

I know.. this sounds like a simple job I could do myself, but as I said, no time Gonzo!

Ray Camden did a little <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=C8B6CE92-0411-13B5-781AF39306642922">RSS.cfc</a> a while back that you could use, so thats a starter for 10. I dont know if the <a href="http://www.fullasagoog.com/">Full as a Goog team</a> would be interested (it might already do this through their webservice) so basically there is enough stuff out there to get this done, without having to build from scratch.

Let me know if anyone is interested!
