I just wanted to ask the community, if one of your gripes is the search functionality in CFEclipse. I didn't want to trawl through the whole of the cf-talk and cfeclipse mailing lists to get feedback so I am asking here.

What is wrong with the search functionality? Does it break down that the search and replace fields are a single line? Or is there some other functionality that is missing?

I appreciate any constructive comments you may have.
