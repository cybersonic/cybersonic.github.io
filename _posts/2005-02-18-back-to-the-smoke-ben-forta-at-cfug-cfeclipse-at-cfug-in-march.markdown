Well, I have been back in London for nearly three weeks and I am still waiting for my furniture to arrive from Spain.
I am still thinking of innovative ways to create temporary furniture, including bean bags (confy, fall asleep easly, end up on the floor) and coffee tables (great for coffee, not so good for coding on!)
London has weather, no more blue skies but at least its .. *interesting*

Last tuesday I went to see Ben Forta talk at the London CFUG to present CFMX7. He is a great talker it must be said and there were interesting questions. The PDF and FlashPaper output is most interesting but I think the idea of Gateways will be widely used once understood. Its obvious that CF is coming of age when developers start talking about threads and gateways. Definately an enterprise tool.

On the CFEclipse front, Spike has re-written the partitioner (what knows where each tag is in a document) and from there we are performing some bug fixes and hopefully get some of the niggles out so that some new features can be implemented better, such as the insertion of tags from the dictionary view and the editing of tags.

I think I might have talked myself into helping Allan Manning at the next presentation of CFUG on the 17th of March  to talk about CFEclipse
