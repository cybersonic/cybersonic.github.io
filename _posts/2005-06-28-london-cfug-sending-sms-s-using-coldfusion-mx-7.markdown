As you may know, using the Event Gateways in Coldfusion MX 7 you can send SMS's. Great I hear you say! But apart from setting up the CFC's and the instance of the event gateway, the questions that most often comes up is how you plug that into your service provider? Do you get a box? A webservice to call? How do you pay for it? etc. Basically the connection between CFMX and a phone service provider is the missing link. Of course this varies from country to country but here in the UK we have a few major service providers to choose from.

Remember that a SMS/Phone Service Provider will charge in "bundles" of text messages, so if you are either starting out or use it for low volumes of traffic you might want to use an "Aggregator" company that will bulk buy from the Service Provider and re-sell it at reasonable rates to you.. the common public.
