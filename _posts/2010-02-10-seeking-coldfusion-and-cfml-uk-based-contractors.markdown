<p>So this is a bit of a fishing post (at least I am being honest!)</p>
<p>In the next few months Railo Technologies will be working on a number of projects and we are  looking to build up a good list of contractors that can work on these projects with us. </p>
<p>I am not posting details of specific jobs of course, but you should have a variety of skills round CFML and CFML development, such as frameworks, ORM techniques, code optimisation and  load testing etc. </p>
<p>Please, read carefully now, I am not looking for agents, I am sure you have wonderful contractors and reasonable rates and make coffee to die for but please do NOT contact me.</p>
<p>So, if you are contracting at the moment, or will be looking for contracts in the UK and Europe over the next few months send me an email with your CV, letting me know which areas you enjoy/are good at/ both/ want to get into etc. </p>
<p>IF YOU ARE NOT AN AGENT, email me over at <a href="mailto:mark@getrailo.com?subject=[RailoCV] I am not an agent">mark at getrailo dot com</a></p>
<p>Finally, as previously mentioned, I shall be treating emails from agents with the contempt they deserve, so don't ruin your day eh?</p>
