Yes you! No, you dont need to code java. No, you dont even need to write beautiful document prose, all you have to do is be a coldfusion developer (you can do that cant you?), be willing to help me finish something, know or want to know ModelGlue and most of all.. use CFEclipse.<br /><br />What needs doing? Well, I have been working on a Model-Glue version of the CFEclipse website that I need to add/finish some features on and basically I dont have the time. I need a pardner in crime. A Samoan attorney to my Hunter S. Thompson.. you get the idea... (mind you.. I probably look more like the Samoan attorney than Hunter S.) It isnt a lot of work. I did most of the site in a day, and just need some other bits adding.<br /><br />So if you fancy helping out, email me and lets do this shindig!
