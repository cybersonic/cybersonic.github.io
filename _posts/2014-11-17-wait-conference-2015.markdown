A good friend of the [CMD](http://charliemikedelta) team, Matt Gifford has [just announced](http://monkehworks.com/wait-2015-call-for-speakers/) the call for speakers for the newly announced [Web Applications in Trend](http://waitconference.eu/) conference!

> Aimed at all creative professionals of all skill levels, we plan to bring you the best content for the modern web with sessions covering tools, processes and development methodologies as well as languages, skills and tips from some of the best speakers around.

> Community is a core part of WAIT 2015 and our main focus as we plan the conference and surrounding details. As such we want the community to be a big part of this event.

At a dead cheap rate of Â£150 for early bird tickets it should be a no brainer as next year's conference of the summer!
