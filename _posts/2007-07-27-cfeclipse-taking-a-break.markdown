I just thought I would post this before people started getting worried about advances in CFEclipse over the next month or so. I have decided to do the Spanish thing and take August off. 

I have been working very hard in the lead up to the "conference season" as well as releasing a number of features in the meantime, on top of which I have had a very busy time at work which is actually leaving me grumpy most of the time. I dont want to loose interest in the project and I think a month apart will probably be good, as they say "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" and all that.

So, this weekend I shall try and squash a couple of bugs and maybe get a release out next week and then take a break until September.

I might even get good at flying now that I got Microsoft Flight Simulator!
