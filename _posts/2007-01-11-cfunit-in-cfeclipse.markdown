Robert Blackburn has a nice little <a href="http://rbdev.net/devblog/index.php?entry=entry070111-013357">set</a> of <a href="http://www.rbdev.net/devblog/index.php?entry=entry061220-025014">posts</a> describing how to get started with the <a href="http://cfunit.sourceforge.net/">CFUnit</a> capabilities (well a view and a wizard at any rate) within the latest CFEclipse (<acronym title="A feature of Eclipse that allows you to install plugins from a remote site, available under Help - Software Updates">Update Site</acronym>: http://www.cfeclipse.org/betaupdate). We shall be adding some more information on how to do this in the new site (coming soon thanks to <a href="http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/andy/blog/index.cfm">Andy J</a> and <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/index.cfm">Andy A</a>!) as well as a getting started in the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse">Trac</a> site (where we are moving as much of the information as possible)


If people would like to help with the documentation effort, <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:znex\056qerj\100tznvy\056pbz\">".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c)\{return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script>let me know!</a>
