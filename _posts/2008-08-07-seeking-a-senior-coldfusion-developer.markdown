A job has come up at my company <a href="http://www.designuk.com/" title="Design UK - Web design agency London">Design UK</a> for a Senior Coldfusion developer. Don't worry, you wont be working under me (well, kinda, you would be situated on the floor below!). 

Before reading the description below, please note a couple of things: I AM NOT GOING TO TALK TO AGENTS. Why? We already have an agency we use, we get a better deal than because we have been using them for years. No. Dont call me. I am not hiring and I am not going to tell you who is. DONT CALL ME. Really. Don't. 

Secondy, this role is based in Picadilly, London. No remote workers. Really. None. Sorry. You obviously need a UK residency and be within commuting time of London.


So, here goes: 
<blockquote>
<strong>Senior Developer</strong>
We're looking for an enthusiastic, experienced, self motivated server side web developer to join our Technical Team. The role will involve building and supporting websites and web applications for our clients.

<strong>Experience</strong>
We're looking for an experienced web developer to join our technical team. The ideal candidate would have 2-3 years experience ideally gained in a new media agency. The core of the role will be web programming but you will also be involved in the complete lifecycle of a project, from specifying technical solutions to providing on going support. So experience in writing specifications, estimating, planning, and dealing with clients are also important.

The main server side skills we are looking for are 
<ul>
	<li>ColdFusion (2 â€“ 3 years + experience)</li>
	<li>SQL Server</li>
	<li>Frameworks (ModelGlue, ColdSpring etc.)</li>
</ul>

Knowledge of Java (Servlets, JSP, Struts & other web Java technologies) would be a definite advantage as would experience with object oriented programming, ANT, Application server deployment & configuration - JRUN & Tomcat and Subversion.

As well as Server side programming skills, you should be familiar with 
<ul>
	<li>XML</li>
	<li>HTML, JavaScript, CSS</li>
</ul>

Knowledge of other programming languages and web development tools are distinct plus notably C, Python, Perl, Flash, PHP, ASP, MySQL, Apache, IIS, Client side libraries (Jquery, Ext etc.)
 
Attitude wise we'd like
<ul>
	<li>Enthusiasm and curiosity about the web and technology</li>
	<li>Good communication & writing skills</li>
	<li>Good technical background </li>
	<li>Good problem solving ability</li>
	<li>Flexibility</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The renumeration is dependent on skills etc. I don't have the figure in front of me, but I am sure they will tell you when you send your CV ;)
