As I am sure a lot of people have noticed, I have been rather quiet on the CFEclipse development front. Well, I am now going to re-start the development of it, and wondered if people (that maybe read this blog) have any features they would really like to see in the next version.

This is a call to feedback for features, that is not bugs (so please dont put "I would really like to see the feature of not having a bug when... xyz"

So its over to you, I have a few features that are coming up, mainly some spring cleaning and changes to the UI.

Thanks for the feedback in advance!
