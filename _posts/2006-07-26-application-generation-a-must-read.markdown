I am not sure if people out there are reading Peter Bell's <a href="http://www.pbell.com/">Application Generation</a> blog, but if you are not, and you are doing ColdFusion OO programming this is a MUST. He is working through how to build  frameworks, in other words generic code that is required for a number of applications. This isnt a "how do I connect to a database" type of thing, instead he has been going through how to create <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/7/21/Pseudo-Page-Controllers">page controllers</a>, <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/7/12/An-Iterating-Business-Object">iterating objects</a> and <a href="http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2006/7/12/Generic-Getters-and-Setters">Generic getters and setters</a> (e.g. ModelGlue's getValue()) amongs other things. This is a great blog and one to keep your eye on.
