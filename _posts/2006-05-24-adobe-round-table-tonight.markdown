Tonight I am off to Olympia 2 for the Adobe Round Table (I sound like a knight!) on <a href="http://events.adobe.co.uk/events/cgi/event.cgi?eventid=3424&country=uk">the future of the internet as an applications platform</a>. Should be interesting, and its a nice diversion from a normal UK CFUG presentation. Nothwistanding I shall be presenting <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=DFC76F2A-F1FF-921E-1825D894DB19E50A">ColdSpring next week a the UK CFUG</a>.
