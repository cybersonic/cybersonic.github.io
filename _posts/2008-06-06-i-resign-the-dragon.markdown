I am not sure if this news has spread through the CFML community, but a couple of weeks ago I stepped down from the OpenBD steering committee.

Rather than going into all the details here I am just going to post my resignation letter that hopefully explains my reasons behind it.

<blockquote>
	Dear Gentlemen

	I have realised that since joining as a member of the steering  
	committee I have contributed bugger all.

	This should not come as a shock to people that know me, since I am a  
	lazy bugger but I think its inappropriate for me to take up space on  
	the committee that could be assigned to someone more intelligent and  
	vocal to contribute.

	I have a number of projects (outside my 9-6 day job) that I need to  
	concentrate on, some that you know and some that you will <a href="http://www.jboss.org/railo/" title="jboss.org: Railo">hopefully  
		know soon enough</a> but this leaves me little time left to give OSBD the  
	attention I would like to give the project.

	Rather than sit around like a silent lurker on the list I am going to  
	make space for a better (not handsomer) person to take my place.

	Of course, I shall keep on lurking in the background... and probably  
	looking at the code going "aint that clever.. yessum!" and wishing the  
	project the total success it needs!

	Finally I would like to thank you for having though of me highly  
	enough to invite me in the first place! And sorry that I couldn't make  
	a bigger contribution
