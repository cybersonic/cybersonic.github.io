I got home last night to find <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stacked-Up-Senser/dp/B00005AXN2/sr=8-1/qid=1166783712/ref=pd_ka_1/202-5218834-0604624?ie=UTF8&s=music">Senser's Stacked Up</a>. This is something I really wanted for a looong time. A favourite band of mine, and I am sure if you havent heard them (they are from SW London and were massive in the UK music scene in the 90's) its time you should too!. Something like a UK Rage Against the Machine with mixtures of the Beastie Boys and dash of Therapy?. Of course, this goes in no way to really define them, like a lot of other genre busting bands its difficult to put them in a little slot. The only slot they belong in is in the CD slot and the volume turned to 11.

Thanks man!!!
