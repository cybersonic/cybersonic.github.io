Robert Blackburn has a great post describing a new feature he has been working on for CFEclipse, <a href="http://rbdev.net/devblog/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=12&amp;entry=entry061220-025014&amp;PHPSESSID=928da4ac4f41004a6a8bf825668cdd41">CFUnit integration.</a>

Hopefully I can get an update up during Christmas as I shall have some time then, and all being well my bluetooth keyboard holds out!
