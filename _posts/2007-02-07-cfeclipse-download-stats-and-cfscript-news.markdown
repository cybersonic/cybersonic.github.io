Just a quick post to let you know that I finally got round to look at the download stats of the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=download">CFEclipse plug-in</a> and I am proud to announce the following stats:
<ul>
<li>Number of Visits getting the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=download">plug-in</a>: 2,845

<li>Number of Hits to the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=download">plug-in</a>: 4,143
</ul>


Since we also have put a manual download of the update site you can also add these stats:
<ul>
<li>Number of Visits getting the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/nightly/cfeclipse_1_3.zip">manual update site</a>: 461

<li>Number of Hits to the <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/nightly/cfeclipse_1_3.zip">manual update site</a>: 464
</ul>



That is not bad, as I figure it (and I can be wrong here) that's roughly 3306 people that have downloaded it.

I don't know if they are all using it, but it it's not bad considering its a specialised tool!

Talking about <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=download">CFEclipse</a>, I asked <a href="http://www.spike.org.uk/blog/index.cfm">Spike</a> to give me a hand fixing the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/cfeclipse/ticket/172">cfscript</a> bug that has been annoying users of <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/index.cfm?event=page&amp;page=download">CFEclipse 1.3</a>, he definitely come up with the goods! He is a star! And we can finally close this bug.

By the way, I am hoping to get a cutting edge release out soon with this fix. I shall keep you posted through the usual channels.
