We wanted to extend a big thank you to all the speakers, sponsors and crew that made the [dev.objective()](http://www.devobjective.com/) conference so much fun this year. 

CMD are really proud to have been one of the sponsors and it was great talking to all the people that come along to our stand.

dev.objective() was formerly cf.objective() but it has had a natural progression over the years to other subjects, so the current change of name I think feels more correct for the content. 

Hopefully we shall see all you all there next year!

Come and say hi!
