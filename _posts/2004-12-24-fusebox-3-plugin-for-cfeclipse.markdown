<a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/">Fusebox 3 Plugin for CFEclipse</a>: "This is a plugin for the CFEclipse project that extends the capabilities of CFEclipse to develop fusebox 3 applications. It provides views and functions in line with good practices for fusebox development"

I started a project about a week ago to develop a plugin for eclipse that would help me with managing and basically browsing Fusebox 3 applications. Its a new View that is added to eclipse that displays your application as a tree with circuits/fuseactions/fuses that you can click from each and go to the relevant file. 

I have  more plans for the plugin but with Olliver Tupman leaving the CFE project and Xmas looming I dont think there will be a lot of checkins from now till the new year! But I would love to hear from people if they have checked it out and used it! Any feedback is welcome!
