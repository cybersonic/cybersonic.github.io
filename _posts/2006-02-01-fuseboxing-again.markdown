<p>As I mentioned I am back on the development tip with the <a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/">Fusebox plugin</a> for <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a>. I am more concentrating on it working with Fusebox 4.1 than 3 (sorry!) 
So if you have any requests for features, let me know!</p>
