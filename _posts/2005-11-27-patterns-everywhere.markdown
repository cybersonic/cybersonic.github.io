Thought I would recommend a site, that I stumbled upon linked from ajform website that I blogged about a couple of days ago, <a href="http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/">AJAX Patterns</a> seems like a great site (well a Wiki) to get all your AJAX related patterns to help you develop your dynamic applications better.

I am currently having a look at a number of AJAX implementations and will be creating a sample application in each to see how easy they are to implement. 

If you have any ideas for an application (e.g. like the PetStore application) that you would like to see developed in AJAX so we can compare, sent me a note.
