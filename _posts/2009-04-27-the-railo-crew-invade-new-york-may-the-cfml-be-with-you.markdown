<p>That's right, before heading to the fantastic <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/">cfObjective</a> conference on Wednesday 13th of May, <a href="http://www.railo.ch/blog/">Gert Franz</a> and myself (Mark Drew in case you didn't realise) will be hanging out in New York with the other Railo Meister <a href="http://www.pbell.com/">Peter Bell</a></p>
<p>We should be arriving in time for Friday the 8th of May, before Escaping from New York and heading up north to Minneapolis! </p>
<p>Nothing confirmed just yet but there should be a cf_drinks happening maybe on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> Monday 11th </span> Tuesday 12th if anyone is in the area? </p>
<p>We promise good deeds and a plethora of interesting accents at least! Come one, come all!</p>
