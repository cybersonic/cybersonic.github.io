On my way out to work I saw a Amazon package containing the excellent book &quot;Contributing to Eclipse: Princibles, Patterns and Plug-ins&quot;. Absolutely astounded as it was sent from my wish list by someone thanking me for my toolbar contributions to CFEclipse.<br /><br />I want to say a big thank you, but I dont know who you are! no details of the sender in the package! But stil.. a massive thank you as it will help me a lot.. finally some structure to my usual poking into the code.<br /><br />I just started reading it on the train but they referenced something that might be very useful for people starting out developing for CFEclipse, its called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaspider/">JavaSpider</a> and it produces a diagram of what is calling which class. I havent checked it out yet but I shall put up my thoughts and comments ont this as I get on with it.<br /><br />Anyway, MANY thanks to whoever sent me the book!
