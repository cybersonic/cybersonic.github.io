Whoa, so it looks like <a href="http://www.thehansofoundation.org/">thehansofoundation.org</a> website has been hacked. There site has gone down and is all red and there is only a message saying

<blockquote>
The Hanso Foundation site has been hacked by malicious infiltrators seeking to blemish the good work of many dedicated researchers. Until a legal investigation is completed, the site will no longer be accessible to the public. Namaste.
</blockquote>

Looking a the sourcecode though, what do we see?

A hidden link to <a href="http://www.rachelblake.com/">http://www.rachelblake.com/</a> which seems to be just a blog about someone going to Denmark (hold on isnt Alvar Hanso from Denmark?)

Just has one post but nothing that interesting in it apart from the <a href="http://www.rachelblake.com/img/europe-map_edit.jpg">background image </a> which seems to show Alvar's travels.

There is also a box asking for "Extra Info" which is actually a flash file called "checkpass.swf" so its time to find a password! 

If anyone can spot more clues there let me know!

I shall be having a proper look today
