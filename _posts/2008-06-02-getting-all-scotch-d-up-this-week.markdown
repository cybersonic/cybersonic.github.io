Tomorrow I shall be heading to Edinburgh for the fantastic <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" title="Scotch on the Rocks 2008 - The European ColdFusion Conference">Scotch on the Rocks</a> conference.

I know <a href="http://www.creative-restraint.co.uk/blog/" title="Creative Restraint">Andy Allan</a> has been working really hard to get this conference going and last year's event was a real blast!

This year I shall be presenting a couple of topics, ColdSpring: Better Living through Configuration and a new topic which is FreshAIR: Developing Adobe AIR applications using Aptana Studio. This makes a change to my usual CFEclipse presentations and I have been working hard on making them both informative and entertaining (no, no juggling... sorry!)

I am really looking forward to meeting some old friends as well as new ones! So come and say hello!
