Are you at CFUnited in Washington DC today? Do you have a (visible) Tattoo that you can show the world (without getting arrested)? Fancy being part of a photo?

I am trying to get people in the community for a group photo showing our ink! 

If you are up for this, meet me at the front of the Integral stand after the Demo Derby today and I shall see if we can all get in on a massive group ink shot!
