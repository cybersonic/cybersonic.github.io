Without realising it, I just broke the 100 post mark. I have been posting since the 13th of October 2003 (thats a cool 863 days), about a post every week and a half. Dissapointly I have only had 76 comments posted.<br /><br />Other crazy stats that I seem to have posted more &quot;personal&quot; tagged posts followed closely by &quot;cfeclipse&quot; <br /><br />the post about the new component explorer has double the comments than any other post.<br /><br />Here goes for the next 100 posts!
