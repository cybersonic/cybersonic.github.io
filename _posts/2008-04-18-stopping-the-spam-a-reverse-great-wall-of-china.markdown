As some of you might have noticed, if you have ever posted a comment on this blog, I have been having a number of spam comments being submitted.

Since I am using captcha for each blog post, I think this is basically sweatshop workers in China being told to do it. (enyone watched <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/jpod/" title="CBC Television - jPod">JPod</a>? same thing). There is no real way round this, since its humans doing it (or maybe install CFKismet or something?). 

The main point is, if I dont have any real readers in China, should I simply block all the IP's that come from there and put a proper message?

What do you think? unfair? I think as a whole it would be, but then again, I dont get many *real* readers from there, speak up if you are though!
