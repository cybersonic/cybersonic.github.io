<a href="http://cfeclipse.tigris.org/releases/announce_1.1.17.html">cfeclipse: CFEclipse 1.1.17 released</a> At long last, althought it must be said that  the releases are coming in fast and furious! Like evolution, it takes a time to build a base onto which you can then start adding great features... once the foundation is laid, a  lot of new features can be added and I forsee this happening a more and more with CFEclipse.

Some of the new features include:
    * 11 Selected text drag 'n' drop
    * 138 Bracket highlighting
    * 17 Block indent/unindent enhancement
    * 183 Code folding
    * 21 Ctrl + Double click selects tag
    * 175 CFML comments
    * 97 CFC Browser enhancement

You can get the update from Eclipse itself via Help -> Software Updates


On a similar related note, Rob Rohan has put some videos up of using CFEclipse as well as the possible logos for the project, check it out here:
