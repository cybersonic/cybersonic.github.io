<p>Today we opened our metaphorical doors here at Mark Drew Consulting. So far it's been a busy day filled with paperwork (ahh, the taxman, how I love thee), some conference calls and then some server administration.</p>
<p>The great guys at <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #3b5d77;" title="Edge Web Hosting - Managed ColdFusion Hosting, Managed Dedicated Servers" href="http://www.edgewebhosting.com/">EdgeWebHosting</a> are managing our new server that this blog and related bits will be moving to, as well as our infrastructure (subversion, trac, etc) so its been getting all that installed.</p>
<p>A lot of people have asked what precisely is Mark Drew Consulting, well, here goes (in the absence of a natty website that will be coming soon):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-image: url(/blog/skins/nautica05/assets/images/bg/submenu1.gif);">A development consultancy for improving your current development process (including frameworks, version control, bug management etc)</li>
<li style="list-style-image: url(/blog/skins/nautica05/assets/images/bg/submenu1.gif);">A hosting consultancy for deploying applications with hosting companies and in the cloud and creating high availability applications.</li>
<li style="list-style-image: url(/blog/skins/nautica05/assets/images/bg/submenu1.gif);">A development house, specializing in CFML based web applications,frameworks and Eclipse tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it, I shall be expanding on those topics over the next couple of weeks on this blog, which will be evolving into the new website. And there are a few other projects that I now have some time to apply myself to that will bring some benefit to the CFML community</p>
<p>It is all a big adventure, and of course, if you have any requirements around these big areas, why don't you let me know via the Contact me section?</p>
