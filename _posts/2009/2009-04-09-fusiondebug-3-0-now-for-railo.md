<p>The great guys at Integral have released yet another great product, <a title="FusionDebug 3.0 BETA 1" href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/labs/fd_railo.cfm">FusionDebug 3.0 beta 1 for Railo</a>! </p>
<p>It has all the features you expect from FusionDebug, but one of the most important things is that is FAST!</p>
<p> Of course, you don't have to believe me, but to prove it, I have done a <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/QosB1OdQX">little video that you can see for yourself.</a> </p>
<p>Thanks Integral!</p>
