Andy Allan, the man behind the "fast-becoming-legendary" <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" title="Scotch on the Road 2009">Scotch-on-the-rocks</a> conference has announced that tickets for this year's conference are finally available! 

The conference spans three locations: London, Manchester and Edinburgh all in a week and should be a blast as always! 

The tickets are priced at £49 + VAT for each event or if you want the full madness of the event, £129 + VAT for all three days.

With some great speakers and awesome content, this shall be a great tour of the British Isles at least!
