<p>It has been a while in the making but finally I can announce that Mark Drew Consulting will be up and running as from the 9th of March. 
</p>
<p>
Mark Drew Consulting is a little firm based in London specializing in CFML development, ColdFusion and Railo administration and deployment, process, development tools, ajax, frameworks as well as training and support. If you have any needs why not come and talk to us, we are friendly, and have cookies.
</p>
<p>
The new website should be going live before the 9th so you can have a look at some of the offerings and if you are interested you can always <a href="mailto:mark@markdrew.co.uk">email</a> me or use the contact form!
</p>
<p>
	
It has been a long time coming and I am sad to be leaving the guys at <a title="Design UK - More Human Than Digital" href="http://www.designuk.com">Design UK</a>, if you have design, ecommerce, emarketing or content management projects you should definitely go talk to them! The smartest people I have worked with in my career and the most fun.
</p>
<p>
	
There are a number of projects I am looking forward to taking off the ground, some that I want to devote more time too and other ideas and developments that I really look forward to sharing with you all in the near future! 
</p>
<p>
I have been so excited about this for the last few weeks, I can tell you that the future is bright!</p>
