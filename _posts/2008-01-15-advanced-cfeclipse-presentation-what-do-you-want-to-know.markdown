So, I am going to be presenting at few conferences this year (more on that soon!) and I wanted to get some community feedback about what you would like to hear about and even get demo's on. 

I have a few things I want to demonstrate but I am sure people out there have questions along the lines of "how do I..." or know of features that thing would be of use to people out there.

So, an open source presentation?? Maybe not but I would welcome your ideas/feedback!
