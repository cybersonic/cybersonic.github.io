I have been looking into frameworks for a project recently, and have had a number of conversations and basically I think it comes down to preference really.

Of course, I have a vested interest since I contribute to <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">CFEclipse</a> as well as have my own plugin for <a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/">Fusebox</a> over at CFOpen (can you guess my preference yet?) but still I wanted to check out which frameworks are the best for the requirements. Its a lot to go through but Simon Horwith posted  about <a href="http://www.cfpetmarket.com/">CF Petmarket</a>, a whole site devoted to the Pet Market application built using different frameworks... go check it out!
