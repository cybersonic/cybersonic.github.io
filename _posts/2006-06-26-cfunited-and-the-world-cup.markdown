I realised this weekend after watching the bloody and dirty game between Portugal and Holland that England will be playing (football/soccer) Portugal on the saturday (at about 11am I think, needs to be confirmed, thats 4pm UK time at any rate) nearly straight after Sean Corfield's Objects and Persistance talk. So, here is the deal, anybody else want to join me into pressuring some bar to show the game? Its on ESPN and ABC (but what do I know of your channels eh?) so it IS available!

This is going to be a crazy match as far as I can see from Portugal's previous behaviour against Holland, so its a definate must-see.
