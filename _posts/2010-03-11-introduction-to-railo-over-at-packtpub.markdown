<p>Spotted today on twitter, a great article: <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/introduction-to-railo-open-source">Introduction to Railo Open Source</a> by  Andrew Schwabe on <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">http://www.packtpub.com/</a></p>
<p>It's great to see the community writing articles that spread the word about Railo far out into other communities, which surely spreads what CFML developer's have known all along that CFML and Railo just gets things done! </p>
