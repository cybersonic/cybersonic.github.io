<p>Having to connect to various IM networks can be annoying, especially if you have friends that will only use X client. So , I downloaded the new MSN Live Messenger and it didnt work. I couldnt connect. I got annoyed, and then Jared told me about <a href="http://www.meebo.com">meebo.com</a> which is a great way to just connect to all my accounts AND it just runs in the browser (which is cool for me, means I dont have to have unnecessary programs open). They just added the feature to add a chat pod on your own site, which I have done under the "Chat to MD" pod, this is a real neat feature (I know there have been a number of clients out there that do it) but its just a nice little Flash app. So if you do fancy a quick chat, just type your name and send me a message!
EDIT: just remember that it might take me a couple of minutes to respond! The browser window that meebo runs in doesnt pop up for me... so it might take me a few seconds at least to notice you have sent me a message!</p>
