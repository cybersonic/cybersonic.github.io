Ok, so these features arent finished, you cant see them. They arent written yet! But these are the things that I am planning to add to the proiject:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>file insight from &lt;cfinclude and &lt;cfmodule so that you can select a file striaght from the tag insight</li>
    <li>Component Method insight. This is a way off yet, but with the work on the Component Explorer hopefully we can get somewhere near. <br /></li>
    <li>Word Wrap. you asked for it. (my personal feelings aside)</li>
    <li><strike>Dragging of different files from the navigator to the editor gives you the correct link code, i.e. if you drag a js you get a &lt;script&gt; tag pre-filled, if you drag a css you get a &lt;link&gt;, if you drag an image you get a &lt;img&gt; tag,&nbsp; and so on. This is just a little help since if you are using a framework, this wouldnt help THAT much</strike> <span style="font-weight: bold;">DONE!</span></li>
    <li>CFUnit test maker. This converts a something.cfc to a Testsomething.cfc so that you can start doing cfunit tests.</li>
    <li>Local help files... as it says on the tin</li>
    <li>Re-mapping of folder paths for components <br /></li>
</ul>
These are the things I can think of. If there are any other features you would like to see here, let me know.
