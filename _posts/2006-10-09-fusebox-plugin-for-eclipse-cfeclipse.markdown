A long while ago, I started a project to do a plugin to develop Fusebox applications using CFEclipse. I stopped using Fusebox and went on to do MG apps and other custom stuff (more webservices that I would rather do to be honest) so the plugin (<a href="http://cfopen.org/projects/fusebox3cfe/">fusebox3cfe</a>) has laid dormant for a while. I just wanted to ask the community out there, if there is a need/want for a plugin that helps you whilst developing fusebox applications?

If so, is there anybody out there that I can shoot questions and would like to make suggestions as to what would help? I understand but dont code it daily enough to know what would increase my workflow (its one thing knowing what the framework does and how to do it, its another to know what all the reptitive tasks and annoyances are)

Leave me a comment with your opinions!
