Well, after more than a month of waiting, my MacBook Pro has finally left the factory and its on its way. Thats the problem with ordering some things online... it takes SOOO long!<br /><br />Now I have to wait another week for it to arrive.. pants!<br /><br />Well, I shall have to keep developing on my little (12&quot;) PowerBook till then.
