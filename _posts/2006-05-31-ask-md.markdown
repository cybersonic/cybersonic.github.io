A great day for updates to the blog!

I have added a new pod underneath the recent entries that allows you to submit any questions you have about Coldfusion, CFEclipse, Macs or anything else that comes to your mind. I know <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm"> Ray Camden </a> does this and I dont want to step on his mighty toes, but also wanted a way for you (if you like) to submit your questions and comments.
