<p>Quick Quick! Go over to the <a href="https://trello.com/b/4M6JSoyL/cf-objective-call-for-speakers-2014">cf.Objective() Trello board</a> and vote for some of the session there! There are some awesome topics that are going through for next year's conference and you only have till the 11th to vote what will make the cut! </p>
<p>I doubt my presentations will make it, but make sure you vote for some excellent talks covering a range of topics (not just CFML!) </p>
<p>Do it or be a equilateral triangle!</p>
