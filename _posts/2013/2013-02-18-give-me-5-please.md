<p>On April 6th, I shall be running the <a href="http://www.thefixevents.com/content/the-tough5-10-15-greenwich-park-2013" target="_blank">Tough 5</a> in Greenwich Park. This will be a challenge for me, an ex smoker and overweight developer with a penchant for drinking Jack Daniels, as the run is not just nice and level, it is up and down the undulating hills of the park! Should be fun! </p>
<p>Of course, this is the bit where you expect me to put up a link to my justgiving page or some other charity, but I don't want to do that.</p>
<p>I know a great diversity of people and I am sure you all know a worthy cause, so here is the deal: Just give five of something to the group/charity/community/product of your choice. That's it.  Be it $5, £5, 5 minutes, or 5 hours, it doesn't matter. Just make sure you do it before Saturday April 6th.</p>
<p>Oh, and why not let me know what you did, either privately or by commenting below! </p>
