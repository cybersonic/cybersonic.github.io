The CFEclipse Project website has had a new section added, TV: Where we show you how to do stuff.

I shall be posting a few more screencasts throughout the day and hopefully through the next few weeks to show you how to use some features of CFEclipse (and Eclipse of course).

Let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions for a screencast!
