Yesterday, and the thrust of this morning's post was that I ws having problems getting data from a cf script from the flex swf's I was creating. The solution was to add a crossdomain.xml file to the root of my local server. This crossdomain file defines what hosts we will accept flash requests from.
Check this page out for more details <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_14213">Macromedia Knowledge Base</a>

I am still left with the problem of not being able to view generated SWF's using http:// but only being able to run them from c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\yadda\something.swf

Annoying isnt it?

I coulddn't find anything that mentined that the swf's generated by Flex Builder are disabled in this manner.
