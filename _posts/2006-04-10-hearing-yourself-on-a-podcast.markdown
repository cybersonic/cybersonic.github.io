A little surprise this morning as I downloaded the <a href="http://www.coldfusionweekly.com/">Coldfusion Weekly Podcast. </a>The first thing I heard was my own voice! Check out this great new podcast by Matt Woodward and Peter Farell. You can call in using skype and leave a nice announcement for the start of the show. <br /><br />The other podcast that I listen to and enjoy regularly is the <a href="http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com">Coldfusion Podcast</a> that I have been listening to a while and its pretty damned good.<br /><br />On the same topic you should also check out <a href="http://www.helmsandpeters.com/">Out Loud,</a> which is Hal Helms and Jeff Peters.
