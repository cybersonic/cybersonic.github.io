Finally I have my flights booked to CFUNITED! I am arriving at D.C.'s Ronald Ray-Gun Airport on Tuesday 26th of June at 16:18. Anybody else arriving around the same time? Fancy sharing a bus thingy? Or is it tube-able? (I can't remember if Ray-Gun was on the tube or not)

I am very excited about this conference, I think I might be releasing the final project (heh, right) for the summer called Project:C but details still need to be worked out (so if I dont release something, dont kill me ok?)
