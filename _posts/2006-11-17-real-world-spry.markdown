I just finished watching <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/index.cfm/2006/11/16/Spry-Presentation-Recording" target="_blank">Ray Camden's fantastic Spry</a> presentation and I realised, I keep forgetting to blog about the stuff I am doing with ColdFusion, <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">Spry</a> and other technologies (what can I say, CFEclipse is what I like talking about!).

Over the last couple of months we at <a href="http://www.designuk.com/" target="_blank">Design UK</a> have released a couple of big retail sites for the UK. They are both driven by ColdFusion (of course) and Java, but I kind of forgot (silly me) that they also have some nice Spry implementation.

<a href="http://www.jaeger.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jaeger</a> is a <em>luxury British brand renowned for designing stylish, innovative and superb quality womenswear, menwear and accessories</em> whose site we redesigned and redeveloped, as well as adding a lot of features (content management and eCommerce), there are some real-world examples of using Spry. The reason I am posting this is that a lot of the examples I have seen are not "in-situ" so I thought people would like to know of sites that ARE using it.

A nice part of the site for you to check it out working are some product pages such as <a href="http://www.jaeger.co.uk/index.cfm?page=1094&amp;productid=600057E&amp;productvar=600057E-05300-S&amp;refpage=1243&amp;refelement=4129" target="_blank">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.jaeger.co.uk/index.cfm?page=1094&amp;productid=150036E&amp;productvar=150036E-07700-S&amp;refpage=1161" target="_blank">this one</a>. Just change the colour and you can see different related products and the image changes.

So, I know its a pre-release technology, but its pretty handy and works really well, go <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/spry/">check it out</a>.
