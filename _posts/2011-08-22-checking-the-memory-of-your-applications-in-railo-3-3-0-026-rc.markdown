<p>If you have ever wondered how your memory is being used in a Railo Server application, why not get the latest development release of Railo Server: 3.3.0.026 rc (you know that you can do this from the server administrator right?). </p>
<p>Just go to http://yourdomain/railo-context/admin/server.cfm and log in, then you can click on the "update" button, set the updates to "Development", update and then click the "execute button below to get the latest update. </p>
<p>Once you have done that, in the Railo Server Administrator screen, you will see info about your installation and scrolling down you will get a nice graphic on how your memory is being used, like the example below:</p>
