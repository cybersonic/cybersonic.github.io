So, after watching today's slightly <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/">disappointing Keynote from  MacWorld Conference and Expo</a>, I decided to buy, through iTunes, the iPod Touch January Software Update ($19.99 or Â£12.99).

Well, slightly dissapointing really, nothing got installed. I am still waiting on the response to my complaint email. 

Anybody managed to install it? Its meant to be easy, just buy it and Sync your iTouch, but alas, no luck.

EDIT: A comment by sidepodcast below has solved the problem. There was an update for the iTouch that I had to install before installing the application package (to be honest, comparing the sizes of the updates, I think what you buy is simply a license for the software). Thanks sidepodcast!!!
