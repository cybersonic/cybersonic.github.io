Thanks to a lot of hard work by <a href="http://www.thecrumb.com/">Jim Priest </a> over the last few weeks, <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org">http://www.cfeclipse.org</a> has been given a thorough making over! 

Jim will be helping the project as the webmaster for the site and has been doing a sterling job in keeping the <a href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org">Trac/Wiki</a> updated for a long while now, so many thanks need to go to his contribution to the project

What do you think of the new site?
