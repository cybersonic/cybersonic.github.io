As some people out there might have noticed, there has been rumours of BlueDragon going Open Source.

I was asked if I would like to contribute to the project by <a href="http://www.fuzzyorange.co.uk/" title="Fuzzy Orange Ltd: ColdFusion Consultancy, Training and Support based out of Scotland">Andy Allan</a> and <a href="http://alan.blog-city.com/" title="Alan Williamson">Alan Williamson</a> a few weeks back and finally the announcement has gone through (in case you hadn't noticed of course!)

Alan asked me to write a few words on my involvement, which you can see over at his blog.

A very exciting time for CFML developers!
