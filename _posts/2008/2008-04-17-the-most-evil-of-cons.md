Today I got a letter, which in itself isn't odd, but the addressing was. It was addressed to me but using an initial that I don't use in day to day transactions. It was also posted from Madrid, Spain. Which is odd since I haven't lived there since I was three, and the last time I lived in Spain, I lived in Valencia so even then. It was odd.


When I opened it I was shocked to find it was a badly written, full length letter stating that someone with the same surname as myself, and his whole family had passed away in the 11th of March train bombing in Madrid. And that since I had the same surname, I could ask for their $77 million  from the bank in a con essentially.

This is a standard Nigerian 419 Scam. But what shocks me is the fact that it was posted, it uses a horrific terrorist attack as its basis and the spelling is atrocious!

These scams seem to be flooding the internet (if I go and browse my spam folder it seems filled with it). Emails are nearly 100% always from a yahoo address and always say of a deal where you would have to go and pick up the money, praise god, say that you are a good person and trustworthy (oh, nice! they know your character over email) and seemed to be spelled by a dyslexic baboon .

What has really worried me about this is how they have obtained my address. So keep an eye out for such scams.
