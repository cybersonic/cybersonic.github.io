Those clever folks at <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> famous for their IDE and Eclipse plugins for JavaScript/Ajax, HTML and CSS have released <a href="http://www.aptana.com/jaxer/">Jaxer</a>, The Ajax Server: 


<blockquote>
...Jaxer changes all that. Jaxer is the world's first true Ajax server. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are native to Jaxer, as are XMLHttpRequests, JSON, DOM scripting, etc. And as a server it offers access to databases, files, and networking, as well as logging, process management, scalability, security, integration APIs, and extensibility
</blockquote>

You can get it as part of the IDE or download the standalone server, for Windows, Mac and Linux.


I dont find this surprising really, since Paul Colton, the CEO and founder is the man behind JRun!

Awesome stuff, and I hope to get some examples up to show you soon!
