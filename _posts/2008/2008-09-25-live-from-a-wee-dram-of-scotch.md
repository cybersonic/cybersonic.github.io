<p>I just finished presenting my "Better living through configuration" presentation at A Wee Dram of Scotch in London. Its a great presentation so far with Adam Lehman and Claude from Adobe kicking off the proceedings and showing the (possible) Hibernate features in Centaur (or the "Eagerly Awaited next version of ColdFusion").Â </p>
<p>The rest of the day should be really interesting, and currently Peter Bell is telling us about RAD OO.</p>
<p>This is the smallest conference I have been to, and I think its great, there are only about 70 people in the same room and its only one day... a great way to really meet other developers (rather than the immense scale of other conferences)</p>
<p>If the wireless picks up, I shall try and post some more today, if not I shall give you a breakdown (after the hangover ) tomorrow!</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is<a href="/blog/assets/content/Presentations/ColdSpring_AWeeDram.zip"> my presentation and code </a>for you to play with!</p>
