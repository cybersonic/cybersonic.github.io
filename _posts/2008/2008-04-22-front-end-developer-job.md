A friend of mine asked me if I knew anyone that would like to apply for the following job:

<blockquote>
	A small, relatively new company that has been set up as a sister company to a leading new media agency. Both companies work closely together and both have recently won new clients and have exciting growth and development plans and potential.  Due to our size, culture and approach to client service we are looking for candidates who can demonstrate an ability to multi task, work under own steam from brief to completion and who are committed to delivering work that works.

	We would ideally like someone who can work on own initiative in Flash, Flash Lite 2 (nice to have), HTML, CSS, ASP. The emphasis would be on Flash but must have an eye to dynamic data driven content and applications, through to flash based sales presenters, banners etc.

	They will need an eye for design (though often design is provided), lateral thought, motion and interactivity when it comes to Flash. In an ideal world they would also have an understanding of .Net or at least what can be done with it.

	Must have lots of energy, passion and dedication to the job  in hand.

	As a company we will be moving towards dynamic applications which may encompass Adobe Air, Flex etc. in the future.

	Salary level: circa Â£35K with possibility of share options
