Its going round, like a bad cold, so I thought I would also chip in with my CFUnited 2008 meme!

<strong>What are you looking forward to most?</strong>
Meeting up with people from the community and hanging out in DC!


<strong>Which speaker will most likely end up on your camera?</strong>
Probably Peter Bell, that guy can write and talk like there is no tomorrow!

<strong>What do you plan to do outside conference time?</strong>
Well, I am looking for a tattoo place to get some stuff added to my arm, and then it will probably be a bar where the rock is loud and the beer is cold. Any suggestions from locals?
I might also head up to Rockville to check out a record shop that Henry Rollins used to frequent.

<strong>Fill in the blank: I will mainly be around the ______ booth.</strong>
"Beer"


<strong>Do you have a new project you are working on and will reveal it at CFUnited?</strong>
Yes, its part of my FreshAir presentation!
