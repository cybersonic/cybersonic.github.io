<p>Over on the <a title="model-glue |
  Google Groups" href="http://groups.google.com/group/model-glue?hl=en">Model-Glue mailing list</a>, Dan Wilson has posted a very quick survey to get feedback and thus improve the features of the framework.</p>
<p>
If you would like the project to grow, why not take a couple of minutes to fill out the survey?
