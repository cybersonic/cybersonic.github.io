Well not really, since I can't call it that, but since it has been posted on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/all.html#alpha-d" title="Adobe - Adobe Community Experts : Find an Adobe Community Expert">Adobe website</a> I can finally admit that I am an Adobe Community Expert! 

With that in mind, I guess I better return to my regularly scheduled blog postings about ColdFusion, CFEclipse et-al! 

I am currently writing a couple of articles that you should hopefully see soon enough in some well known community publications (there I have said it, I have to do it now!) as well as delving deeper into big applications using Model-Glue and changes to Reactor to make it more fun to work with! 

So, hello world :)
