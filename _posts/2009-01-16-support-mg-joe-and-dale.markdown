This is a bit of a personal posting, but Joe Rinehart's wife Dale was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) just after Christmas. You may have heard about it and if not, you can read more about it on <a href="http://firemoss.com/post.cfm/my-wife-dale-rinehart-has-ms-and-a-great-attitude" title="My wife, Dale Rinehart, has MS (and a great attitude!) | Joe Rinehart on ColdFusion, Flex, and Java">his blog</a>.

<p>
I have met Joe a few times and apart from being the brains behind Model-Glue, the framework that I use daily he is also an awesome person who I would love to help, and I presume (because I am like that) that if you are a member of the CF community you would too! Head over to <a href="http://www.helpsupportjoeanddale.com/" title="Dale Rinehart Donations">http://www.helpsupportjoeanddale.com/</a> to show your support. Do it. We are a small enough community that we should be supporting the stars in it.
