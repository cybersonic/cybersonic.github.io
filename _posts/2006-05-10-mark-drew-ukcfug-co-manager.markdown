Yes indeedy folks! I have joined up with Niklas Richardson to manage the UKCFUG in London!<br /><br />I have become more and more involved this year (2 presentations so far!) and I think its a great way to get news and information out there to the community. It will be an exciting year (it has been so far!) with a couple of new things happening, <br /><br />First of:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=1A765865-F1FF-921E-1459C18A66705587" target="_blank">The future of the Internet as an&nbsp; Applications Platform (24-May-06)</a> which is being run by Adobe over at the Olympia Conference Center <br />Followed by: <a href="http://www.ukcfug.org/index.cfm?objectid=DFC76F2A-F1FF-921E-1825D894DB19E50A" target="_blank">Model-Glue and Coldspring: Inversion of Control and Configuration </a>presentation by me.<br />After that, the next meeting lands right in the middle of CFUNITED, so since I am going, I am looking for people to interview, live, over iChat with feedback from the CFUG back in London. Anyone interested?
