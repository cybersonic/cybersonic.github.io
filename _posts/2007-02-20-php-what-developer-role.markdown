An old friend contacted me today, and he is seeking a contract PHP developer. I know, I tried to convert him to the "one true way", and this might happen  but for this phase of a project he is seeking someone with PHP skills.

Do you know anyone that fits the following bill?
<blockquote>
I am looking to hire (contract for at least 2 to 3 months, full time or part time) an experienced PHP programmer to work on a new business-to-business auction site project. We have the basic version of PHPProBid up and running and I have made some minor mods but I need someone to run the development of at least the launch of the first version by the end of March this year. I am in the process of hiring an offshore PHP house to do much of the bulk of the work but the ideal team would have a local (London) PHP/MySQL expert to oversee the work and interface with the team.

If you are interested or know someone that is please let me know.

Please contact me at <a href="mailto:jonb@chapadao.com?subject=php developer role from Mark Drew's blog">jonb@chapadao.com</a> with a quick summary of yourself and availability.
</blockquote>

I hasten to add on his behalf, no agencies please.

Send him an email if you are up for the task!
