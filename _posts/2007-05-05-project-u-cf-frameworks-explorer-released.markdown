On the first day of cfObjective() 2007 I released the top secret project called Project Unity. This project is easily described as a plugin for CFEclipse which displays an overview of any ColdFusion framework you happen to be using. It is highly configurable in that you can define your own framework if need be and add actions and labels to each of the nodes of a tree.

I shall be releasing more information over the coming days, but you can give it a try with your framework by updating cfeclipse and adding the CF Frameworks plugin from the extras directory.

Its in Alpha so dont complain too much!

Also, a new version of CFeclipse has been released, which should solve some of the errors that you guys have been having.

I shall be doing more release docs over the next few days when I get back from cfObjective()!
