I know this isnt related to any technology, but I am chuffed, I got a new tattoo on saturday (and other mishaps involving tequila, strangely enough, AFTER I got the tattoo).

Check it!

I should mention that I got this done by Charlie at <a href="http://www.kidsloveinkdeptford.co.uk/">Kids Love Ink</a>, which is an awesome place in of itself!
