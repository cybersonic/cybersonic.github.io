I want to introduce a new podcast that I am hosting with <a href="https://twitter.com/robdudley">Rob Dudley</a>; <a href="https://soundcloud.com/localhostfm">The Localhost Podcast</a>!

The idea behind this podcast is that of a monthly chat between us about a topic in web development. To kick of the year we are talking about <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and all things container. The way we do this is slightly different to a lot of podcasts as we need YOUR comments and questions as these are the fuel for our dicussions. 

You can follow the podcast on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/localhostfm">@localhostfm</a>

Anyway, enjoy the first podcast:
