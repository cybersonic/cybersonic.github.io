It is great to see that Sean Corfield will be helping out with the CFEclipse project!

He will be helping us to plan a feature roadmap for the next release and is currently looking for ideas on features.

Check out his post over at the <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=10A1C887-B265-CF8C-D2D514009C620DC6">An Architect's View</a>

Some of the features discussed in his blog were

<ol>   <li>Word Wrap (no, I dont like it neither as I know the guts and those guts dont wanna be touched)</li>   <li>More RDS Functions</li>   <li>Tag Insight</li>   <li>Intellisense </li>   <li>Integrated Help</li>   <li>Debugging</li>   <li>Component and Webservice Info</li> </ol>
Any other thoughts send them over to Sean!
