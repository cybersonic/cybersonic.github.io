I had a great time last year in Melbourne and glad that this year I won't just be manning the Railo stand (do come and say hello!) but I shall also be doing a presentation on CouchDB </p>
<p> </p>
<p>CouchDB is a "noSQL" database that is rather exciting in how it works as well as a highly performant document database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you manage to make it, make sure you either come to my session or at least pop by and say hello to the Railo team! </p>
