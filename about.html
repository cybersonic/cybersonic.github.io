This blog, written by Mark Drew (see definition below) is mainly a technical blog covering areas such as ColdFusion, Railo/Lucee, MongoDB, Node, Meteor, CFML, Apple hardware and software, web development amongst a few of the subjects. I try to keep it as factual as possible and with original content, without repeating posts from other blogs, unless I think it would be something my readers wouldn&#39;t have caught elsewhere or its really interesting. That said, I am sure I shall break that rule.
